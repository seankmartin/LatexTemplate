	abstract = {In cerebral cortex, ongoing activity absent a stimulus can resemble stimulus-driven activity in size and structure. In particular, spontaneous activity in cat primary visual cortex (V1) has structure signiﬁcantly correlated with evoked responses to oriented stimuli. This suggests that, from unstructured input, cortical circuits selectively amplify speciﬁc activity patterns. Current understanding of selective ampliﬁcation involves elongation of a neural assembly’s lifetime by mutual excitation among its neurons. We introduce a new mechanism for selective ampliﬁcation without elongation of lifetime: ‘‘balanced ampliﬁcation.’’ Strong balanced ampliﬁcation arises when feedback inhibition stabilizes strong recurrent excitation, a pattern likely to be typical of cortex. Thus, balanced ampliﬁcation should ubiquitously contribute to cortical activity. Balanced ampliﬁcation depends on the fact that individual neurons project only excitatory or only inhibitory synapses. This leads to a hidden feedforward connectivity between activity patterns. We show in a detailed biophysical model that this can explain the cat V1 observations.},

Fortunately, modern brain imaging techniques have, over the past 40 years, substantially changed the situation by permitting the safe appraisal of both anatomical and functional relationships within the living human brain. An unexpected feature of this work is the critical importance of ongoing, intrinsic activity, which accounts for the majority of brain’s energy consumption and exhibits a surprising level of organization that emerges with dimensions of both space and time. In this essay, some of the unique features of intrinsic activity are reviewed, as it relates to our understanding of brain organization.},

	abstract = {Cortical layers have classically been identiﬁed by their distinctive and prevailing cell types and sizes, as well as the packing densities of cell bodies or myelinated ﬁbers. The densities of multiple receptors for classical neurotransmitters also vary across the depth of the cortical ribbon, and thus determine the neurochemical properties of cyto- and myeloarchitectonic layers. However, a systematic comparison of the correlations between these histologically deﬁnable layers and the laminar distribution of transmitter receptors is currently lacking. We here analyze the densities of 17 different receptors of various transmitter systems in the layers of eight cytoarchitectonically identiﬁed, functionally (motor, sensory, multimodal) and hierarchically (primary and secondary sensory, association) distinct areas of the human cerebral cortex. Maxima of receptor densities are found in different layers when comparing different cortical regions, i.e. laminar receptor densities demonstrate differences in receptorarchitecture between isocortical areas, notably between motor and primary sensory cortices, specifically the primary visual and somatosensory cortices, as well as between allocortical and isocortical areas. Moreover, considerable differences are found between cytoarchitectonical and receptor architectonical laminar patterns. Whereas the borders of cyto- and myeloarchitectonic layers are well comparable, the laminar proﬁles of receptor densities rarely coincide with the histologically deﬁned borders of layers. Instead, highest densities of most receptors are found where the synaptic density is maximal, i.e. in the supragranular layers, particularly in layers II–III. The entorhinal cortex as an example of the allocortex shows a peculiar laminar organization, which largely deviates from that of all the other cortical areas analyzed here.},

We tested three models of this regularity, originally formulated for primate cerebral cortex, using quantitative data on the relative supragranular layer origins (SGN\%) of 151 projections from 19 areas (∼145,000 neurons) to four areas of cat extrastriate cortex. Predictive variables in the models were: hierarchical level differences (Barone et al., 2000), structural type differences (Barbas, 1986), and distances (Salin and Bullier, 1995) between areas. Global and local hierarchies of cat visual cortex were used to evaluate the hierarchical model. Ranking of areas by their cytoarchitectural differentiation (e.g., relative prominence of layer IV) allowed testing of the structural model, while the distance model was tested for the number of borders separating areas. Laminar projection origins correlated moderately with hierarchical differences, and poorly with border distances, but were strongly and consistently correlated with area differences in cytoarchitectural rank. Moreover, projection densities were moderately and negatively correlated with area distances and structural differences. Our ﬁndings suggest that the relative cytoarchitectural differentiation of cortical areas is the main determinant of laminar projection origins in cat visual cortex, and may underlie a general laminar regularity of mammalian cortical connections.},

	abstract = {Distinct anatomical and spectral channels are thought to play specialized roles in the communication within cortical networks. While activity in the alpha and beta frequency range (7 – 40 Hz) is thought to predominantly originate from infragranular cortical layers conveying feedback-related information, activity in the gamma range ({\textgreater}40 Hz) dominates in supragranular layers communicating feedforward signals. We leveraged high precision MEG to test this proposal, directly and non-invasively, in human participants performing visually cued actions. We found that visual alpha mapped onto deep cortical laminae, whereas visual gamma predominantly occurred more superficially. This lamina-specificity was echoed in movement-related sensorimotor beta and gamma activity. These lamina-specific pre- and post- movement changes in sensorimotor beta and gamma activity suggest a more complex functional role than the proposed feedback and feedforward communication in sensory cortex. Distinct frequency channels thus operate in a lamina-specific manner across cortex, but may fulfill distinct functional roles in sensory and motor processes.
          , 
            As we interact with the world around us, signals flow from neuron to neuron and from one brain area to the next. When we look at an object, for example, signals pass along a pathway of areas in the outermost part of the brain, called the cortex. Each area along this visual pathway performs more complex processing than the one before it. But information also flows in the opposite direction along such cortical pathways. These feedback signals enable areas further along the pathway to influence the activity of those before them.
            Studies in animals suggest that much like a highway, information is travelling in opposite directions within the cortex along different lanes. In mammals, these lanes consist of distinct layers of cells. In the visual cortex of monkeys, feedback signals travel via deeper layers of cortex, whereas feedforward signals travel via the upper layers. Brain activity in the upper layers also has a higher frequency than that in the lower layers.
            But is this also the case in our own brains? Bonaiuto et al. used a technique called MEG to measure the frequency of brain activity within the upper and lower layers of cortex in healthy volunteers. The volunteers had to look at images on a screen and then respond by pressing a button. Bonaiuto et al. observed that activity in deeper layers of cortex occurred mostly at lower frequencies, while activity in upper layers mostly happened at higher frequencies. This pattern, which matches that seen in monkeys, was found in both visual cortex and in areas of cortex that help plan and execute movements. In visual cortex, the activity in the upper layers appeared to carry feedforward signals. But in movement-related areas, feedback and feedforward signals were less clearly related to cortical layers.
            These findings lend support to current theories about how the cortex is organized. They also show that MEG can reveal rapidly changing brain activity at a high spatial resolution. The findings may also provide clues to the origins of brain disorders called oscillopathies. These involve changes in specific frequencies of brain activity, and include schizophrenia and epilepsy, among others.},

to key players of the cast, the cortex and hippocampus, without providing any unique functional
contribution. In recent years, evidence from multiple laboratories researching different thalamic
nuclei has contradicted this idea of the thalamus as a passive structure. Dated models of thalamic
functions are being pushed aside, revealing a greater and far more complex contribution of the
thalamus for cognition. In this Viewpoint, we show how recent data support novel views of thalamic
functions that emphasize integrative roles in cognition, ranging from learning and memory to flexible
adaption. We propose that these apparently separate cognitive functions may, in fact, be supported
by a more general role in shaping mental representations. Several features of thalamocortical circuits
are consistent with this suggested role and we highlight how divergent and convergent
thalamocortical and corticothalamic pathways may complement each other to support these
functions. Furthermore, the role of the thalamus for subcortical integration is highlighted as a key
mechanism for maintaining and updating representations. Finally, we discuss future areas of
research and stress the importance of incorporating new experimental findings into existing
knowledge to continue developing thalamic models. The presence of thalamic pathology in a number
of neurological conditions reinforces the need to better understand the role of this region in cognition.},

We recorded visual responses simultaneously from three successive stages of the cat visual system: retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), thalamic (LGN) relay cells, and simple cells in layer 4 of primary visual cortex. Spike count variability was lower than that of a Poisson process at all three stages but increased at each stage. Absolute and relative refractory periods largely accounted for the reliability at all three stages. Our results show that cortical responses can be more reliable than previously thought. The differences in reliability in retina, LGN, and cortex can be explained by (1) decreasing firing rates and (2) decreasing absolute and relative refractory periods.},

	abstract = {In the present paper we apply a new neurophysiological technique to make single-electrode, dual loose-patch recordings from pairs of neuronal elements in the cerebellar cortex in vivo. The analyzed cell pairs consisted of an inhibitory molecular layer interneuron and a Purkinje cell (PC) or a Golgi cell and a granule cell, respectively. To detect the magnitude of the unitary inhibitory synaptic inputs we used histograms of the spike activity of the target cell, triggered by the spikes of the inhibitory cell. Using this analysis, we found that single interneurons had no detectable effect on PC firing, which could be explained by an expected very low synaptic weight of individual interneuron-PC connections. However, interneurons did have a weak delaying effect on the overall series of interspike intervals of PCs. Due to the very high number of inhibitory synapses on each PC, a concerted activation of the interneurons could still achieve potent PC inhibition as previously shown. In contrast, in the histograms of the Golgi cell-granule cell pairs, we found a weak inhibitory effect on the granule cell but only at the time period defined as the temporal domain of the slow IPSP previously described for this connection. Surprisingly, the average granule cell firing frequency sampled at one second was strongly modulated with a negative correlation to the overall firing level of the Golgi cell when the latter was modified through current injection via the patch pipette. These findings are compatible with that tonic inhibition is the dominant form of Golgi cell-granule cell inhibition in the adult cerebellum in vivo.},

These waves can be spontaneously generated by recurrent circuits or evoked by external stimuli. They travel along brain networks at multiple scales, transiently modulating spiking and excitability as they pass. Here, we review recent experimental findings that have found evidence for travelling waves at single-area (mesoscopic) and wholebrain (macroscopic) scales. We place these findings in the context of the current theoretical understanding of wave generation and propagation in recurrent networks. During the large lowfrequency rhythms of sleep or the relatively desynchronized state of the awake cortex, travelling waves may serve a variety of functions, from long-term memory consolidation to processing of dynamic visual stimuli. We explore new avenues for experimental and computational understanding of the role of spatiotemporal activity patterns in the cortex.},

Cerebellar granule cells receive ﬁve orders of magnitude fewer inputs than the Purkinje cells they innervate, and cerebellum-like circuits, including the insect mushroom body, also exhibit large divergences in connectivity. In contrast, the number of inputs per neuron in cerebral cortex is more uniform and large. We investigate how the dimension of a representation formed by a population of neurons depends on how many inputs each neuron receives and what this implies for learning associations. Our theory predicts that the dimensions of the cerebellar granule-cell and Drosophila Kenyon-cell representations are maximized at degrees of synaptic connectivity that match those observed anatomically, showing that sparse connectivity is sometimes superior to dense connectivity. When input synapses are subject to supervised plasticity, however, dense wiring becomes advantageous, suggesting that the type of plasticity exhibited by a set of synapses is a major determinant of connection density.},

This presents a problem for understanding the functioning of the brain, because downstream neuronal populations ought to construct accurate stimulus representations, even upon singular exposure. To study how trial-by-trial ﬂuctuations (i.e., noise) in activity inﬂuence cortical representations of sensory input, we performed chronic calcium imaging of GCaMP6-expressing populations in mouse V1. We observed that high-dimensional response correlations, i.e., dependencies in activation strength among multiple neurons, can be used to predict single-trial, single-neuron noise. These multidimensional correlations are structured such that variability in the response of single neurons is relatively harmless to population representations of visual stimuli. We propose that multidimensional coding may represent a canonical principle of cortical circuits, explaining why the apparent noisiness of neuronal responses is compatible with accurate neural representations of stimulus features.},

Across multiple cortical areas, integration is characterized by two neuronal response properties: (1) surround suppression—modulatory contextual stimuli suppress responses to driving stimuli; and (2) ‘‘normalization’’—responses to multiple driving stimuli add sublinearly. These depend on input strength: for weak driving stimuli, contextual inﬂuences facilitate or more weakly suppress and summation becomes linear or supralinear. Understanding the circuit operations underlying integration is critical to understanding cortical function and disease. We present a simple, general theory. A wealth of integrative properties, including the above, emerge robustly from four cortical circuit properties: (1) supralinear neuronal input/output functions; (2) sufﬁciently strong recurrent excitation; (3) feedback inhibition; and (4) simple spatial properties of intracortical connections. Integrative properties emerge dynamically as circuit properties, with excitatory and inhibitory neurons showing similar behaviors. In new recordings in visual cortex, we conﬁrm key model predictions.},

The impact of correlated noise upon population coding has been debated, but a direct connection between theory and experiment remains tenuous. Here, we substantiate this connection and propose a reﬁned theoretical picture. Using simultaneous recordings from a population of direction-selective retinal ganglion cells, we demonstrate that coding beneﬁts from noise correlations. The effect is appreciable already in small populations, yet it is a collective phenomenon. Furthermore, the stimulus-dependent structure of correlation is key. We develop simple functional models that capture the stimulus-dependent statistics. We then use them to quantify the performance of population coding, which depends upon interplays of feature sensitivities and noise correlations in the population. Because favorable structures of correlation emerge robustly in circuits with noisy, nonlinear elements, they will arise and beneﬁt coding beyond the conﬁnes of retina.},

Yet our understanding of how populations of neurons in interconnected brain areas communicate is in its infancy. Here we investigate how trial-to-trial ﬂuctuations of population responses in primary visual cortex (V1) are related to simultaneously recorded population responses in area V2. Using dimensionality reduction methods, we ﬁnd that V1-V2 interactions occur through a communication subspace: V2 ﬂuctuations are related to a small subset of V1 population activity patterns, distinct from the largest ﬂuctuations shared among neurons within V1. In contrast, interactions between subpopulations within V1 are less selective. We propose that the communication subspace may be a general, population-level mechanism by which activity can be selectively routed across brain areas.},

	abstract = {Dual intracellular recordings in slices of adult rat neocortex and hippocampus investigated slow, putative GABAB receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. In most pairs tested in which the interneuron elicited a fast inhibitory postsynaptic potential in the pyramid, this GABAA receptor mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potential was entirely blocked by bicuculline or picrotoxin (3:3 in neocortex, 6:8 in CA1, all CA1 basket cells), even when high-frequency presynaptic spike trains were elicited. However, in three of 85 neocortical paired recordings involving an interneuron, although no discernible response was elicited by single presynaptic interneuronal spikes, a long latency (Ն20 ms) inhibitory postsynaptic potential was elicited by a train of Ն3 spikes at frequencies Ն50–100 Hz. This slow inhibitory postsynaptic potential was insensitive to bicuculline (one pair tested). In neocortex, slow inhibitory postsynaptic potential duration reached a maximum of 200 ms even with prolonged presynaptic spike trains. In contrast, summing fast, GABAA inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, elicited by spike trains, lasted as long as the train. Between four and 10 presynaptic spikes, mean peak slow inhibitory postsynaptic potential amplitude increased sharply to 0.38, 2.6 and 2.9 mV, respectively, in the three neocortical pairs (membrane potential Ϫ60 to Ϫ65 mV). Thereafter increases in spike number had little additional effect on amplitude. In two of eight pairs in CA1, one involving a presynaptic basket cell and the other a putative bistratiﬁed interneuron, the fast inhibitory postsynaptic potential was blocked by bicuculline revealing a slow inhibitory postsynaptic potential that was greatly reduced by 100 mM CGP 35348 (basket cell pair). The sensitivity of this slow inhibitory postsynaptic potential to spike number was similar to that of neocortical ‘pure’ slow inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, but was of longer duration, its plateau phase outlasting 200 ms spike trains and its maximum duration exceeding 400 ms. Computational models of GABA release, diffusion and uptake suggested that extracellular accumulation of GABA cannot alone account for the non-linear relationship between spike number and inhibitory postsynaptic potential amplitude. However, cooperativity in the kinetics of GABAB transduction mechanisms provided non-linear relations similar to experimental data. Different kinetic models were considered for how G-proteins activate Kϩ channels, including allosteric models. For all models, the best ﬁt to experimental data was obtained with four G-protein binding sites on the Kϩ channels, consistent with a tetrameric structure for the Kϩ channels associated with GABAB receptors.},

	abstract = {The human visual system can be divided into over two-dozen distinct areas, each of which contains a topographic map of the visual field. A fundamental question in vision neuroscience is how the visual system integrates information from the environment across different areas. Using neuroimaging, we investigated the spatial pattern of correlated BOLD signal across eight visual areas on data collected during rest conditions and during naturalistic movie viewing. The correlation pattern between areas reflected the underlying receptive field organization with higher correlations between cortical sites containing overlapping representations of visual space. In addition, the correlation pattern reflected the underlying widespread eccentricity organization of visual cortex, in which the highest correlations were observed for cortical sites with iso-eccentricity representations including regions with non-overlapping representations of visual space. This eccentricity-based correlation pattern appears to be part of an intrinsic functional architecture that supports the integration of information across functionally specialized visual areas.
          , 
            Imagine you are looking out over a scenic landscape. The image you perceive is actually made up of many different visual components—for example color and movement—that are processed across many different areas in a region of the brain called the visual cortex. An important question for neuroscience is how the visual system combines information from so many different areas to create a coherent picture of the world around us.
            Many areas of the visual cortex have their own map of what we see (the visual field). These maps allow the brain to maintain its representation of the visual field as the information passes from one processing area to the next. Areas that process corresponding parts of the visual field are physically interconnected, and tend to be active at the same time, which suggests that they are working together in some way. In addition, areas of the visual cortex that process different sections of the visual field can be activated at the same time, but it is not clear how this works.
            Here, Arcaro et al. used a technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to image the brains of people as they watched movies and while they rested. The images showed that seemingly unrelated areas of the visual cortex respond in similar ways if they are processing sections of the visual field that are the same distance from the center of the person's gaze. For example, if you look directly at the center of a computer screen parts of the brain that process the top of the screen are active at the same time as parts that process the bottom.
            Arcaro et al.'s findings suggest that the brain uses the distance from the center of our gaze to bring together information from different areas of the visual cortex. This offers a new insight into how the brain assembles the many pieces of the visual jigsaw to make a complete picture. Future work will investigate how the architecture of the visual cortex is able to support this coupling of different areas, and how it might influence our perception of the visual world.},

An increasing number of rodent electrophysiology studies are examining these substrates together, thus providing circuit-level perspectives on input convergence, synaptic plasticity and functional coupling, as well as insights into cognition mechanisms and brain disorders. Our review article puts this literature into a method-oriented narrative. As revisited throughout the text, limbic thalamic and hippocampal afferents to the PFC gate one another’s inputs, which in turn are modulated by PFC interneurons and ascending monoaminergic projections. In addition, long-term synaptic plasticity, paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), and event-related potentials (ERP) dynamically vary across PFC-related circuits during learning paradigms and drug effects. Finally, thalamic-prefrontal loops, which have been shown to amplify both cognitive processes and limbic seizures, are also being implicated as relays in the prefrontal-hippocampal feedback, contributing to spatial navigation and decision making. Based on these issues, we conclude the review with a critical synthesis and some research directions.},

	abstract = {Tinnitus is the conscious perception of sound heard in the absence of physical sound sources external or internal to the body, reﬂected in aberrant neural synchrony of spontaneous or resting-state brain activity. Neural synchrony is generated by the nearly simultaneous ﬁring of individual neurons, of the synchronization of membrane-potential changes in local neural groups as reﬂected in the local ﬁeld potentials, resulting in the presence of oscillatory brain waves in the EEG. Noise-induced hearing loss, often resulting in tinnitus, causes a reorganization of the tonotopic map in auditory cortex and increased spontaneous ﬁring rates and neural synchrony. Spontaneous brain rhythms rely on neural synchrony. Abnormal neural synchrony in tinnitus appears to be conﬁned to speciﬁc frequency bands of brain rhythms. Increases in delta-band activity are generated by deafferented/deprived neuronal networks resulting from hearing loss. Coordinated reset (CR) stimulation was developed in order to speciﬁcally counteract such abnormal neuronal synchrony by desynchronization. The goal of acoustic CR neuromodulation is to desynchronize tinnitus-related abnormal delta-band oscillations. CR neuromodulation does not require permanent stimulus delivery in order to achieve long-lasting desynchronization or even a full-blown anti-kindling but may have cumulative effects, i.e., the effect of different CR epochs separated by pauses may accumulate. Unlike other approaches, acoustic CR neuromodulation does not intend to reduce tinnitus-related neuronal activity by employing lateral inhibition. The potential efﬁcacy of acoustic CR modulation was shown in a clinical proof of concept trial, where effects achieved in 12 weeks of treatment delivered 4–6 h/day persisted through a preplanned 4week therapy pause and showed sustained long-term effects after 10 months of therapy, leading to 75\% responders.},

We investigated their in vivo impact by expressing channelrhodopsin in three main sources of feedback to rat S1: primary motor cortex, secondary somatosensory cortex, and secondary somatosensory thalamic nucleus (the posterior medial nucleus, POm). Inputs from cortical areas were relatively weak. POm, however, more robustly depolarized L2/3 cells and, when paired with peripheral stimulation, evoked action potentials. POm triggered not only a stronger fast-onset depolarization but also a delayed all-or-none persistent depolarization, lasting up to 1 s and exhibiting alpha/beta-range oscillations. Inactivating POm somata abolished persistent but not initial depolarization, indicating a recurrent circuit mechanism. We conclude that secondary thalamus can enhance L2/3 responsiveness over long periods. Such timescales could provide a potential modality-specific substrate for attention, working memory, and plasticity.},

	abstract = {Although signaling between neurons is central to the functioning of the brain, we still do not understand how the code used in signaling depends on the properties of synaptic transmission. Theoretical analysis combined with patch clamp recordings from pairs of neocortical pyramidal neurons revealed that the rate of synaptic depression, which depends on the probability of neurotransmitter release, dictates the extent to which firing rate and temporal coherence of action potentials within a presynaptic population are signaled to the postsynaptic neuron. The postsynaptic response primarily ref lects rates of firing when depression is slow and temporal coherence when depression is fast. A wide range of rates of synaptic depression between different pairs of pyramidal neurons was found, suggesting that the relative contribution of rate and temporal signals varies along a continuum. We conclude that by setting the rate of synaptic depression, release probability is an important factor in determining the neural code.},

	abstract = {Both invasive and non-invasive electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings from the human brain have an increasingly important role in neuroscience research and are candidate modalities for medical brain–machine interfacing. It is often assumed that the major artifacts that compromise non-invasive EEG, such as caused by blinks and eye movement, are absent in invasive EEG recordings. Quantitative investigations on the signal quality of simultaneously recorded invasive and non-invasive EEG in terms of artifact contamination are, however, lacking. Here we compared blink related artifacts in non-invasive and invasive EEG, simultaneously recorded from prefrontal and motor cortical regions using an approach suitable for detection of small artifact contamination. As expected, we ﬁnd blinks to cause pronounced artifacts in noninvasive EEG both above prefrontal and motor cortical regions. Unexpectedly, signiﬁcant blink related artifacts were also found in the invasive recordings, in particular in the prefrontal region. Computing a ratio of artifact amplitude to the amplitude of ongoing brain activity, we ﬁnd that the signal quality of invasive EEG is 20 to above 100 times better than that of simultaneously obtained non-invasive EEG. Thus, while our ﬁndings indicate that ocular artifacts do exist in invasive recordings, they also highlight the much better signal quality of invasive compared to non-invasive EEG data. Our ﬁndings suggest that blinks should be taken into account in the experimental design of ECoG studies, particularly when event related potentials in fronto-anterior brain regions are analyzed. Moreover, our results encourage the application of techniques for reducing ocular artifacts to further optimize the signal quality of invasive EEG.},

Here, we address the computational beneﬁts of expansion and sparseness for clustered inputs, where different clusters represent behaviorally distinct stimuli and intracluster variability represents sensory or neuronal noise. Through analytical calculations and numerical simulations, we show that expansion implemented by feed-forward random synaptic weights ampliﬁes variability in the incoming stimuli, and this noise enhancement increases with sparseness of the expanded representation. In addition, the low dimensionality of the input layer generates overlaps between the induced representations of different stimuli, limiting the beneﬁt of expansion. Highly sparse expansive representations obtained through synapses that encode the clustered structure of the input reduce both intrastimulus variability and the excess overlaps between stimuli, enhancing the ability of downstream neurons to perform classiﬁcation and recognition tasks. Implications for olfactory, cerebellar, and visual processing are discussed.},

However, due to the lack of effective modeling methods, how the simultaneously recorded LFP can inform us about the brain dynamics remains a general challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel sparse coding based method to investigate brain dynamics of freely-behaving mice from the perspective of functional connectivity, using super-long local field potential (LFP) recordings from 13 distinct regions of the mouse brain. Compared with surrogate datasets, six and four reproducible common functional connectivities were discovered to represent the space of brain dynamics in the frequency bands of alpha and theta respectively. Modeled by a finite state machine, temporal transition framework of functional connectivities was inferred for each frequency band, and evident preference was discovered. Our results offer a novel perspective for analyzing neural recording data at such high temporal resolution and recording length, as common functional connectivities and their transition framework discovered in this work reveal the nature of the brain dynamics in freely behaving mice.},

Here, we addressed these questions using two-photon calcium imaging of intact zebraﬁsh larvae to monitor the neuron-to-neuron spontaneous activity ﬁne structure in the tectum, a region involved in visual spatial detection. Spontaneous activity was organized in topographically compact assemblies, grouping functionally similar neurons rather than merely neighboring ones, reﬂecting the tectal retinotopic map despite being independent of retinal drive. Assemblies represent all-or-none-like sub-networks shaped by competitive dynamics, mechanisms advantageous for visual detection in noisy natural environments. Notably, assemblies were tuned to the same angular sizes and spatial positions as prey-detection performance in behavioral assays, and their spontaneous activation predicted directional tail movements. Therefore, structured spontaneous activity represents ‘‘preferred’’ network states, tuned to behaviorally relevant features, emerging from the circuit’s intrinsic non-linear dynamics, adapted for its functional role.},

However, most methods for high-bandwidth acquisition of behavioral data in mice rely upon ﬁxed-position cameras and other off-animal devices, complicating the monitoring of animals freely engaged in natural behaviors. Here, we report the development of a lightweight head-mounted camera system combined with head-movement sensors to simultaneously monitor eye position, pupil dilation, whisking, and pinna movements along with head motion in unrestrained, freely behaving mice. The power of the combined technology is demonstrated by observations linking eye position to head orientation; whisking to non-tactile stimulation; and, in electrophysiological experiments, visual cortical activity to volitional head movements.},

The circuit mechanisms underlying this process are unresolved. The claustrum possesses interconnectivity with many cortical areas and, thus, is hypothesized to orchestrate the cortical mantle for top-down control. Whether the claustrum receives top-down input and how this input may be processed by the claustrum have yet to be formally tested, however. We reveal that a rich anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) input to the claustrum encodes a preparatory topdown information signal on a ﬁve-choice response assay that is necessary for optimal task performance. We further show that ACC input monosynaptically targets claustrum inhibitory interneurons and spiny glutamatergic projection neurons, the latter of which amplify ACC input in a manner that is powerfully constrained by claustrum inhibitory microcircuitry. These results demonstrate ACC input to the claustrum is critical for top-down control guiding action.},

The complexity of biological neural networks substantially exceeds the complexity of DNNs, making it even more challenging to understand the representations they learn. Thus, both machine learning and computational neuroscience are faced with a shared challenge: how can we analyze their representations in order to understand how they solve complex tasks? We review how data-analysis concepts and techniques developed by computational neuroscientists can be useful for analyzing representations in DNNs, and in turn, how recently developed techniques for analysis of DNNs can be useful for understanding representations in biological neural networks. We explore opportunities for synergy between the two fields, such as the use of DNNs as in silico model systems for neuroscience, and how this synergy can lead to new hypotheses about the operating principles of biological neural networks. © 2019 The Authors},

	abstract = {Predictive coding is a theoretical framework that provides a functional interpretation of top-down and bottom up interactions in sensory processing. The theory suggests there are differences in message passing up vs. down the cortical hierarchy. These differences result from the linear feedforward of prediction errors, and the nonlinear feedback of predictions. This implies that cross-frequency interactions should predominate top-down. But it remains unknown whether these differences are expressed in cross-frequency interactions in the brain. Here we examined bi-directional cross-frequency coupling across four sectors of the auditory hierarchy in the macaque. We computed two measures of cross-frequency coupling, phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) and amplitude-amplitude coupling (AAC). Our findings revealed distinct patterns for bottom-up and top-down information processing among cross -frequency interactions. Both top-down and bottom-up made prominent use of low frequencies: low-to-low frequency (θ, α, β) and low frequency-to-high γ couplings were predominant top-down, while low frequency-to-low γ couplings were predominant bottom-up. These patterns were largely preserved across coupling types (PAC and AAC) and across stimulus types (natural and synthetic auditory stimuli), suggesting they are a general feature of information processing in auditory cortex. Our findings suggest the modulatory effect of low frequencies on γ-rhythms in distant regions is important for bi-directional information transfer. The finding of low frequency-to-low γ interactions in the bottom-up direction suggest non-linearities may also play a role in feedforward message passing. Altogether, the patterns of cross-frequency interaction we observed across the auditory hierarchy are largely consistent with the predictive coding framework.
Significance The brain consists of highly interconnected cortical areas, yet the patterns in directional cortical communication are not fully understood, in particular with regards to interactions between different signal components across frequencies. We employed a novel, convenient and computationally advantageous Granger-causal framework to examine bi-directional cross-frequency interactions across four sectors of the auditory cortical hierarchy in macaques. Our findings reveal cross-frequency interactions are predominant in the top-down direction, with important implications for theories of information processing in the brain such as predictive coding. Our findings thereby extend the view of cross-frequency interactions in auditory cortex, suggesting they also play a prominent role in top-down processing.},

	abstract = {Visual attention, which improves perception of attended locations or objects, has long been known to affect many aspects of the responses of neuronal populations in visual cortex. There are two nonmutually exclusive hypotheses concerning the neuronal mechanisms that underlie these perceptual improvements. The first hypothesis, that attention improves the information encoded by a population of neurons in a particular cortical area, has considerable physiological support. The second hypothesis is that attention improves perception by selectively communicating relevant visual information. This idea has been tested primarily by measuring interactions between neurons on very short timescales, which are mathematically nearly independent of neuronal interactions on longer timescales. We tested the hypothesis that attention changes the way visual information is communicated between cortical areas on longer timescales by recording simultaneously from neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) and the middle temporal area (MT) in rhesus monkeys. We used two independent and complementary approaches. Our correlative experiment showed that attention increases the trial-to-trial response variability that is shared between the two areas. In our causal experiment, we electrically microstimulated V1 and found that attention increased the effect of stimulation on MT responses. Together, our results suggest that attention affects both the way visual stimuli are encoded within a cortical area and the extent to which visual information is communicated between areas on behaviorally relevant timescales.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Visual attention dramatically improves the perception of attended stimuli. Attention has long been thought to act by selecting relevant visual information for further processing. It has been hypothesized that this selection is accomplished by increasing communication between neurons that encode attended information in different cortical areas. We recorded simultaneously from neurons in primary visual cortex and the middle temporal area while rhesus monkeys performed an attention task. We found that attention increased shared variability between neurons in the two areas and that attention increased the effect of microstimulation in V1 on the firing rates of MT neurons. Our results provide support for the hypothesis that attention increases communication between neurons in different brain areas on behaviorally relevant timescales.},

If so, it should depend on non-visual factors that affect the encoding of position in hippocampus, such as the physical distance traveled and the phase of theta oscillations. We recorded V1 and CA1 neurons while mice ran through a virtual corridor and confirmed these predictions. Spatial representations in V1 and CA1 were correlated even in the absence of visual cues. Moreover, similar to CA1 place cells, the spatial responses of V1 neurons were influenced by the physical distance traveled and the phase of hippocampal theta oscillations.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Many studies of large-scale neural systems have emphasized the importance of communication through increased inter-region correlations ("functional connectivity") during task states relative to resting state. In contrast, local circuit studies have demonstrated that task states reduce correlations among local neural populations, likely enhancing their information coding. Here we sought to adjudicate between these conflicting perspectives, assessing whether large-scale system correlations tend to increase or decrease during task states. To establish a mechanistic framework for interpreting changes in neural correlations, we conceptualized neural populations as having a sigmoidal neural transfer function. In a computational model we found that this straightforward assumption predicts reductions in neural populations9 dynamic output range as task-evoked activity levels increase, reducing responsiveness to inputs from other regions (i.e., reduced correlations). We demonstrated this empirically in large-scale neural populations across two highly distinct data sets: human functional magnetic resonance imaging data and non-human primate spiking data. We found that task states increased global neural activity, while globally quenching neural variability and correlations. Further, this global reduction of neural correlations led to an overall increase in dimensionality (reflecting less information redundancy) during task states, providing an information-theoretic explanation for task-induced correlation reductions. Together, our results provide an integrative mechanistic account that encompasses measures of large-scale neural activity, variability, and correlations during resting and task states.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

To what extent are predictive deep learning models of neural responses useful for generating experimental hypotheses? Bashivan et al. took an artificial neural network built to model the behavior of the target visual system and used it to construct images predicted to either broadly activate large populations of neurons or selectively activate one population while keeping the others unchanged. They then analyzed the effectiveness of these images in producing the desired effects in the macaque visual cortex. The manipulations showed very strong effects and achieved considerable and highly selective influence over the neuronal populations. Using novel and non-naturalistic images, the neural network was shown to reproduce the overall behavior of the animals' neural responses.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONThe pattern of light that strikes the eyes is processed and re-represented via patterns of neural activity in a “deep” series of six interconnected cortical brain areas called the ventral visual stream. Visual neuroscience research has revealed that these patterns of neural activity underlie our ability to recognize objects and their relationships in the world. Recent advances have enabled neuroscientists to build ever more precise models of this complex visual processing. Currently, the best such models are particular deep artificial neural network (ANN) models in which each brain area has a corresponding model layer and each brain neuron has a corresponding model neuron. Such models are quite good at predicting the responses of brain neurons, but their contribution to an understanding of primate visual processing remains controversial.
RATIONALEThese ANN models have at least two potential limitations. First, because they aim to be high-fidelity computerized copies of the brain, the total set of computations performed by these models is difficult for humans to comprehend in detail. In that sense, each model seems like a “black box,” and it is unclear what form of understanding has been achieved. Second, the generalization ability of these models has been questioned because they have only been tested on visual stimuli that are similar to those used to “teach” the models. Our goal was to assess both of these potential limitations through nonhuman primate neurophysiology experiments in a mid-level visual brain area. We sought to answer two questions: (i) Despite these ANN models’ opacity to simple “understanding,” is the knowledge embedded in them already useful for a potential application (i.e., neural activity control)? (ii) Do these models accurately predict brain responses to novel images?
RESULTSWe conducted several closed-loop neurophysiology experiments: After matching model neurons to each of the recorded brain neural sites, we used the model to synthesize entirely novel “controller” images based on the model’s implicit knowledge of how the ventral visual stream works. We then presented those images to each subject to test the model’s ability to control the subject’s neurons. In one test, we asked the model to try to control each brain neuron so strongly as to activate it beyond its typically observed maximal activation level. We found that the model-generated synthetic stimuli successfully drove 68\% of neural sites beyond their naturally observed activation levels (chance level is 1\%). In an even more stringent test, the model revealed that it is capable of selectively controlling an entire neural subpopulation, activating a particular neuron while simultaneously inactivating the other recorded neurons (76\% success rate; chance is 1\%).Next, we used these non-natural synthetic controller images to ask whether the model’s ability to predict the brain responses would hold up for these highly novel images. We found that the model was indeed quite accurate, predicting 54\% of the image-evoked patterns of brain response (chance level is 0\%), but it is clearly not yet perfect.
CONCLUSIONEven though the nonlinear computations of deep ANN models of visual processing are difficult to accurately summarize in a few words, they nonetheless provide a shareable way to embed collective knowledge of visual processing, and they can be refined by new knowledge. Our results demonstrate that the currently embedded knowledge already has potential application value (neural control) and that these models can partially generalize outside the world in which they “grew up.” Our results also show that these models are not yet perfect and that more accurate ANN models would produce even more precise neural control. Such noninvasive neural control is not only a potentially powerful tool in the hands of neuroscientists but also could lead to a new class of therapeutic applications. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/364/6439/eaav9436/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Collection of images synthesized by a deep neural network model to control the activity of neural populations in primate cortical area V4.We used a deep artificial neural network to control the activity pattern of a population of neurons in cortical area V4 of macaque monkeys by synthesizing visual stimuli that, when applied to the subject’s retinae, successfully induced the experimenter-desired neural response patterns.
Particular deep artificial neural networks (ANNs) are today’s most accurate models of the primate brain’s ventral visual stream. Using an ANN-driven image synthesis method, we found that luminous power patterns (i.e., images) can be applied to primate retinae to predictably push the spiking activity of targeted V4 neural sites beyond naturally occurring levels. This method, although not yet perfect, achieves unprecedented independent control of the activity state of entire populations of V4 neural sites, even those with overlapping receptive fields. These results show how the knowledge embedded in today’s ANN models might be used to noninvasively set desired internal brain states at neuron-level resolution, and suggest that more accurate ANN models would produce even more accurate control.

	abstract = {Neuronal populations in sensory cortex produce variable responses to sensory stimuli and exhibit intricate spontaneous activity even without external sensory input. Cortical variability and spontaneous activity have been variously proposed to represent random noise, recall of prior experience, or encoding of ongoing behavioral and cognitive variables. Recording more than 10,000 neurons in mouse visual cortex, we observed that spontaneous activity reliably encoded a high-dimensional latent state, which was partially related to the mouse’s ongoing behavior and was represented not just in visual cortex but also across the forebrain. Sensory inputs did not interrupt this ongoing signal but added onto it a representation of external stimuli in orthogonal dimensions. Thus, visual cortical population activity, despite its apparently noisy structure, reliably encodes an orthogonal fusion of sensory and multidimensional behavioral information.},

	abstract = {Spatial learning requires remembering and choosing paths to goals. Hippocampal place cells replay spatial paths during immobility in reverse and forward order, offering a potential mechanism. However, how replay mediates both goal-directed learning and memory-guided decision making is unclear. We therefore continuously tracked replay in the same hippocampalprefrontal ensembles throughout learning of a spatial alternation task. We found that during pauses between behavioral trajectories, awake reverse and forward hippocampal replay consistently mediated an internal cognitive search of all available past and future possibilities, and exhibited opposing learning gradients for prediction of past and future behavioral paths, respectively. Coordinated hippocampal-prefrontal replay mediated recall of correct past paths and selection of future choices leading to reward based on the hippocampal cognitive search, executing spatial working memory rules. Our findings reveal a learning shift from hippocampal reverse-replay-based retrospective evaluation to forward-replay-based prospective planning, with prefrontal filtering of memory-guided paths for learning and decision-making.},

	abstract = {Hippocampal place cells encode an animal’s current position in space during exploration [1]. During sleep, hippocampal network activity recapitulates patterns observed during recent experience: place cells with overlapping spatial ﬁelds show a greater tendency to co-ﬁre (‘‘reactivation’’) [2], and temporally ordered and compressed sequences of place cell ﬁring observed during wakefulness are reinstated (‘‘replay’’) [3–5]. Reactivation and replay may underlie memory consolidation [6–10]. Compressed sequences of place cell ﬁring also occur during exploration: during each cycle of the theta oscillation, the set of active place cells shifts from those signaling positions behind to those signaling positions ahead of an animal’s current location [11, 12]. These ‘‘theta sequences’’ have been linked to spatial planning [13]. Here, we demonstrate that, before weaning (post-natal day [P]21), ofﬂine place cell activity associated with sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) reﬂects predominantly stationary locations in recently visited environments. By contrast, sequential place cell ﬁring, describing extended trajectories through space during exploration (theta sequences) and subsequent rest (replay), emerge gradually after weaning in a coordinated fashion, possibly due to a progressive decrease in the threshold for experience-driven plasticity. Hippocampus-dependent learning and memory emerge late in altricial mammals [14–17], appearing around weaning in rats and slowly maturing thereafter [14,15]. In contrast, spatially localized ﬁring is observed 1 week earlier (with reduced spatial tuning and stability) [18–21]. By examining the development of hippocampal reactivation, replay, and theta sequences, we show that the coordinated maturation of ofﬂine consolidation and online sequence generation parallels the late emergence of hippocampal memory in the rat.},

In addition, we show that the precise timing of coincident CA3 and CA1 place cell spikes in relation to SWR onset is critical for the induction of LTP and predictive of plasticity generated by reactivation. Our ﬁndings conﬁrm an important role for SWRs in triggering and tuning plasticity processes that underlie memory consolidation in the hippocampus during rest or sleep.},

	abstract = {Infants are experts at playing, with an amazing ability to generate novel structured behaviors in unstructured environments that lack clear extrinsic reward signals. We seek to mathematically formalize these abilities using a neural network that implements curiosity-driven intrinsic motivation. Using a simple but ecologically naturalistic simulated environment in which an agent can move and interact with objects it sees, we propose a “world-model” network that learns to predict the dynamic consequences of the agent’s actions. Simultaneously, we train a separate explicit “self-model” that allows the agent to track the error map of its worldmodel. It then uses the self-model to adversarially challenge the developing world-model. We demonstrate that this policy causes the agent to explore novel and informative interactions with its environment, leading to the generation of a spectrum of complex behaviors, including ego-motion prediction, object attention, and object gathering. Moreover, the world-model that the agent learns supports improved performance on object dynamics prediction, detection, localization and recognition tasks. Taken together, our results are initial steps toward creating ﬂexible autonomous agents that self-supervise in realistic physical environments.},

Little is known about how neuronal diversity contributes to function in the subiculum. Previously, in vitro studies have identified distinct bursting patterns in the subiculum. Here, we asked how burst firing is related to spatial coding in vivo. Using juxtacellular recordings in freely moving male rats, we studied the bursting behavior of 102 subicular principal neurons and distinguished two populations: sparsely bursting (∼80\%) and dominantly bursting neurons (∼20\%). These bursting behaviors were not linked to anatomy: both cell types were found all along the proximodistal and radial axes of the subiculum and all identified cells were pyramidal neurons. However, the distinct burst firing patterns were related to functional differences: the activity of sparsely bursting cells showed a stronger spatial modulation than the activity of dominantly bursting neurons. In addition, all cells classified as boundary cells were sparsely bursting cells. In most sparsely bursting cells, bursts defined sharper firing fields and carried more spatial information than isolated spikes. We conclude that burst firing is functionally relevant to subicular spatially tuned neurons, possibly by serving as a mechanism to transmit spatial information to downstream structures.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The subiculum is the major output structure of the hippocampal formation and is involved in spatial navigation. In vitro, subicular cells can be distinguished by their ability to initiate bursts as brief sequences of spikes fired at high frequencies. Little is known about the relationship between cellular diversity and spatial coding in the subiculum. We performed high-resolution juxtacellular recordings in freely moving rats and found that bursting behavior predicts functional differences between subicular neurons. Specifically, sparsely bursting cells have lower firing rates and carry more spatial information than dominantly bursting cells. Additionally, bursts fired by sparsely bursting cells encoded spatial information better than isolated spikes, indicating that bursts act as a unit of information dedicated to spatial coding.},

	abstract = {Neuron activity across the brain
How is it that groups of neurons dispersed through the brain interact to generate complex behaviors? Three papers in this issue present brain-scale studies of neuronal activity and dynamics (see the Perspective by Huk and Hart). Allen et al. found that in thirsty mice, there is widespread neural activity related to stimuli that elicit licking and drinking. Individual neurons encoded task-specific responses, but every brain area contained neurons with different types of response. Optogenetic stimulation of thirst-sensing neurons in one area of the brain reinstated drinking and neuronal activity across the brain that previously signaled thirst. Gründemann et al. investigated the activity of mouse basal amygdala neurons in relation to behavior during different tasks. Two ensembles of neurons showed orthogonal activity during exploratory and nonexploratory behaviors, possibly reflecting different levels of anxiety experienced in these areas. Stringer et al. analyzed spontaneous neuronal firing, finding that neurons in the primary visual cortex encoded both visual information and motor activity related to facial movements. The variability of neuronal responses to visual stimuli in the primary visual area is mainly related to arousal and reflects the encoding of latent behavioral states.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONMotivational drives are internal states that can explain why animals adaptively display distinct behaviors in response to the same external stimulus. Physiological needs (e.g., for food and water) are thought to produce specific drives that engage particular goal-directed behaviors to promote survival. These drives are established through the activity of populations of hypothalamic neurons that sense physiological variables and relay this information to other parts of the brain. However, it is unclear how the activity of these hypothalamic neurons activates and coordinates other brain systems involved in sensation, decision-making, and action in order to produce the appropriate goal-directed behavior. The cellular dynamics of brainwide states underlying basic survival drives have heretofore remained inaccessible.
RATIONALEUnderstanding the neural basis of motivated behavior would require measuring activity within distributed neural circuits in the brain and studying how this activity is regulated by the animal’s motivational state. Recent advances in extracellular electrophysiological recording technology have enabled large-scale measurements of neuronal activity throughout the brains of behaving animals. This technology could lead to a spatiotemporal map of activity flow across the brain as an animal senses and responds to stimuli under different conditions. By examining the animal in different motivational states, we could determine how these states are represented in diverse brain regions and how these states influence neuronal activity across the brain to alter behavior.
RESULTSWe recorded the activity of {\textasciitilde}24,000 neurons throughout 34 brain regions during thirst-motivated choice behavior; these recordings were performed across 87 sessions from 21 mice as they gradually consumed water and became sated. We found that more than half of recorded neurons were modulated by this task, with a rapid and widespread response to a water-predicting olfactory cue preceding sustained activity related to water acquisition. The animal’s satiety state gated this wave of activity: In satiated mice, the same sensory cue produced only a transient change in activity and no behavioral response. Surprisingly, the spontaneous baseline activity of neurons across many brain regions was also modulated by the animal’s satiety state.We found diverse correlates of the task at the single-neuron level, with many neurons’ activity correlating with specific sensory cues or behavior, and some of them highly modulated by satiety state. Neurons from each of these groups were distributed throughout the brain, with each brain area differing in the relative proportions of different types of neurons. We separated the high-dimensional population activity dynamics into lower-dimensional state-, cue-, and behavior-related modes. Whereas the cue- and behavior-related modes were primarily modulated by the task in a satiety state–dependent manner, activity along the state mode was persistent throughout the trial, including the period before odor onset. Thus, there existed a brainwide representation of satiety state that appeared to gate the flow of activity in response to sensory inputs.Finally, as a causal test of the role of this widespread encoding of satiety state, we optogenetically stimulated hypothalamic thirst neurons and caused mice to perform more trials after reaching satiety. We found that this focal stimulation returned the behavior, brainwide single-neuron within-trial dynamics, and brainwide single-neuron correlates of satiety state back to the state corresponding to thirst. Stimulation also specifically modulated activity along the satiety-related mode in a subset of brain areas.
CONCLUSIONOur experiments revealed a global representation of the thirst motivational state throughout the brain, which appears to gate the brainwide propagation of sensory information and its subsequent transformation into behavioral output. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science-sciencemag-org.elib.tcd.ie/content/sci/364/6437/eaav3932/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Brainwide dynamics of thirst motivational drive.Top left: Potential models for widespread or selective regulation of neural dynamics by thirst.

Physiological needs produce motivational drives, such as thirst and hunger, that regulate behaviors essential to survival. Hypothalamic neurons sense these needs and must coordinate relevant brainwide neuronal activity to produce the appropriate behavior. We studied dynamics from {\textasciitilde}24,000 neurons in 34 brain regions during thirst-motivated choice behavior in 21 mice as they consumed water and became sated. Water-predicting sensory cues elicited activity that rapidly spread throughout the brain of thirsty animals. These dynamics were gated by a brainwide mode of population activity that encoded motivational state. After satiation, focal optogenetic activation of hypothalamic thirst-sensing neurons returned global activity to the pre-satiation state. Thus, motivational states specify initial conditions that determine how a brainwide dynamical system transforms sensory input into behavioral output.
Water deprivation establishes a brainwide activity state that gates how sensory stimuli produce behavioral responses.

	abstract = {Many complex spike cells in the hippocampus of the freely moving rat have as their primary correlate the animal's location in an environment (place cells). In contrast, the hippocampal electroer cephalograph theta pattern of rhythmical waves (7–12 Hz) is better correlated with a class of movements that change the rat's location in an environment. During movement through the place field, the complex spike cells often fire in a bursting pattern with an interburst frequency in the same range as the concurrent electroencephalograph theta. The present study examined the phase of the theta wave at which the place cells fired. It was found that firing consistently began at a particular phase as the rat entered the field but then shifted in a systematic way during traversal of the field, moving progressively forward on each theta cycle. This precession of the phase ranged from 100° to 355° in different cells. The effect appeared to be due to the fact that individual cells had a higher interburst rate than the theta frequency. The phase was highly correlated with spatial location and less well correlated with temporal aspects of behavior, such as the time after place field entry. These results have implications for several aspects of hippocampal function. First, by using the phase relationship as well as the firing rate, place cells can improve the accuracy of place coding. Second, the characteristics of the phase shift constrain the models that define the construction of place fields. Third, the results restrict the temporal and spatial circumstances under which synapses in the hippocampus could be modified.},

	abstract = {Key points During the computation of sound localization, neurons of the lateral superior olive (LSO) integrate synaptic excitation arising from the ipsilateral ear with inhibition from the contralateral ear. We characterized the functional connectivity of the inhibitory and excitatory inputs onto LSO neurons in terms of unitary synaptic strength and convergence. Unitary IPSCs can generate large conductances, although their strength varies over a 10-fold range in a given recording. By contrast, excitatory inputs are relatively weak. The conductance associated with IPSPs needs to be at least 2-fold stronger than the excitatory one to guarantee effective inhibition of action potential (AP) firing. Computational modelling showed that strong unitary inhibition ensures an appropriate slope and midpoint of the tuning curve of LSO neurons. Conversely, weak but numerous excitatory inputs filter out spontaneous AP firing from upstream auditory neurons. Abstract The lateral superior olive (LSO) is a binaural nucleus in the auditory brainstem in which excitation from the ipsilateral ear is integrated with inhibition from the contralateral ear. It is unknown whether the strength of the unitary inhibitory and excitatory inputs is adapted to allow for optimal tuning curves of LSO neuron action potential (AP) firing. Using electrical and optogenetic stimulation of afferent synapses, we found that the strength of unitary inhibitory inputs to a given LSO neuron can vary over a ∼10-fold range, follows a roughly log-normal distribution, and, on average, causes a large conductance (9 nS). Conversely, unitary excitatory inputs, stimulated optogenetically under the bushy-cell specific promoter Math5, were numerous, and each caused a small conductance change (0.7 nS). Approximately five to seven bushy cell inputs had to be active simultaneously to bring an LSO neuron to fire. In double stimulation experiments, the effective inhibition window caused by IPSPs was short (1−3 ms) and its length depended on the inhibitory conductance; an ∼2-fold stronger inhibition than excitation was needed to suppress AP firing. Computational modelling suggests that few, but strong, unitary IPSPs create a tuning curve of LSO neuron firing with an appropriate slope and midpoint. Furthermore, weak but numerous excitatory inputs reduce the spontaneous AP firing that LSO neurons would otherwise inherit from their upstream auditory neurons. Thus, the specific connectivity and strength of unitary excitatory and inhibitory inputs to LSO neurons is optimized for the computations performed by these binaural neurons.},

The neuronal mechanisms that generate synchronous synaptic inputs in the neocortex are far from being fully understood. In this paper, we study the emergence of synchronization in networks of bursting neurons as a highly non-trivial, combined effect of electrical and inhibitory connections. We report a counterintuitive find that combined electrical and inhibitory coupling can synergistically induce robust synchronization in a range of parameters where electrical coupling alone promotes anti-phase spiking and inhibition induces anti-phase bursting. We reveal the underlying mechanism, which uses a balance between hidden properties of electrical and inhibitory coupling to act together to synchronize neuronal bursting. We show that this balance is controlled by the duty cycle of the self-coupled system which governs the synchronized bursting rhythm., This article is part of the themed issue ‘Mathematical methods in medicine: neuroscience, cardiology and pathology’.},

The quantification of the information encoded by spikes has been standard procedure to identify which cells have spatial correlates. For place cells, most of the established metrics derive from Shannon’s mutual information (Shannon, 1948), and convey information rate in bits/sec or bits/spike (Skaggs et al., 1993; Skaggs et al., 1996). Despite their widespread use, the performance of these metrics in relation to the original mutual information metric has never been investigated. In this work, using simulated and real data, we find that the current information metrics correlate less with the accuracy of spatial decoding than the original mutual information metric. We also find that the top informative cells may differ among metrics, and show a surrogate-based normalization that yields comparable spatial information estimates. Since different information metrics may identify different neuronal populations, we discuss current and alternative definitions of spatially informative cells, which affect the metric choice.},

Assuming the point of view of a read-out neuron that receives synaptic inputs from a population of projecting neurons, synaptic inputs are weighted with a heterogeneous set of weights. We propose that synaptic weights reflect the role of each neuron within the population for the computational task that the network has to solve. In our case, the computational task is discrimination of binary classes of stimuli, and weights are such as to maximize the discrimination capacity of the network. We compute synaptic weights as the feature weights of an optimal linear classifier. Once weights have been learned, they weight spike trains in real time and allow to compute the post-synaptic current that modulates the spiking probability of the read-out unit. We apply the method on parallel spike trains from V1 and V4 areas in the behaving monkey macaca mulatta, while the animal is engaged in a visual discrimination task with binary classes of stimuli. The read-out of spike trains with our method allows to discriminate the two classes of stimuli, while simpler methods as the population PSTH entirely fail to do so. Splitting neurons in two subpopulations according to the sign of the weight, we show that population signals of the two functional subnetworks are negatively correlated. Disentangling the superficial, the middle and the deep layer of the cortex, we show that in both V1 and V4, superficial layers are the best in discriminating binary classes of stimuli.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Hippocampal lesions cause spatial learning deficits, and single hippocampal cells show location-specific firing patterns, known as place fields. This suggests the hippocampus plays a critical role in navigation by providing an ongoing indication of the animal's momentary spatial location. One question that has received little attention is how this locational signal is used by downstream brain regions to orchestrate actual navigational behavior. As a first step, we have examined the spatial firing correlates of cells in the dorsal subiculum as rats navigate in an open-field, pellet-searching task. The subiculum is one of the few major output zones for the hippocampus, and it, in turn, projects to numerous other brain areas, each thought to be involved in various learning and memory functions. Most subicular cells showed a robust locational signal. The patterns observed were different from those in the hippocampus, however, in that cells tended to fire throughout much of the environment, but showed graded, location-related rate modulation, such that there were some localized regions of high firing and other regions with relatively low firing. There were slight quantitative differences between the proximal (adjacent to the hippocampus) and distal (farther from the hippocampus) subicular regions, with distal cells showing slightly higher average firing rates, spatial signaling, and firing field size. This was of interest since these two regions have different efferent connections. Examination of spike trains allowed classification of cells into bursting, nonbursting, and theta (putative interneuron) categories, and this is similar to subicular cell types identified in vitro. Interestingly, the bursting and nonbursting types did not differ detectably in spatial firing properties, suggesting that differences in intrinsic membrane properties do not necessitate differences in coding of environmental inputs. The results suggest that the subiculum transmits a robust, highly distributed spatial signal to each of its projection areas, and that this signal is transmitted in both a bursting and nonbursting mode.},

A majority of subicular pyramidal neurons communicate via bursts of action potentials, a mode of signaling that may enhance the fidelity of information transfer and synaptic plasticity or contribute to epilepsy when unchecked. In the present study, we show that a Ca2+ tail current drives bursting in subicular pyramidal neurons. An action potential activates voltage-activated Ca2+ channels, which deactivate slowly enough during action potential repolarization to produce an afterdepolarization that triggers subsequent action potentials in the burst. The Ca2+ channels underlying bursting are located primarily near the soma, and the amplitude of Ca2+tail currents correlates with the strength of bursting across cells. Multiple channel subtypes contribute to Ca2+ tail current, but the need for an action potential to produce the slow depolarization suggests a central role for high-voltage-activated Ca2+ channels in subicular neuron bursting.},

	abstract = {Action potentials are the end product of synaptic integration, a process influenced by resting and active neuronal membrane properties. Diversity in these properties contributes to specialized mechanisms of synaptic integration and action potential firing, which are likely to be of functional significance within neural circuits. In the hippocampus, the majority of subicular pyramidal neurons fire high-frequency bursts of action potentials, whereas CA1 pyramidal neurons exhibit regular spiking behavior when subjected to direct somatic current injection. Using patch-clamp recordings from morphologically identified neurons in hippocampal slices, we analyzed and compared the resting and active membrane properties of pyramidal neurons in the subiculum and CA1 regions of the hippocampus. In response to direct somatic current injection, three subicular firing types were identified (regular spiking, weak bursting, and strong bursting), while all CA1 neurons were regular spiking. Within subiculum strong bursting neurons were found preferentially further away from the CA1 subregion. Input resistance (RN), membrane time constant (τm), and depolarizing “sag” in response to hyperpolarizing current pulses were similar in all subicular neurons, while RN and τm were significantly larger in CA1 neurons. The first spike of all subicular neurons exhibited similar action potential properties; CA1 action potentials exhibited faster rising rates, greater amplitudes, and wider half-widths than subicular action potentials. Therefore both the resting and active properties of CA1 pyramidal neurons are distinct from those of subicular neurons, which form a related class of neurons, differing in their propensity to burst. We also found that both regular spiking subicular and CA1 neurons could be transformed into a burst firing mode by application of a low concentration of 4-aminopyridine, suggesting that in both hippocampal subfields, firing properties are regulated by a slowly inactivating, D-type potassium current. The ability of all subicular pyramidal neurons to burst strengthens the notion that they form a single neuronal class, sharing a burst generating mechanism that is stronger in some cells than others.},

	abstract = {1. Intracellular recordings were used to examine the membrane properties and evoked responses of subicular neurons in horizontal and parasagittal slices from guinea pig brain as a step toward understanding excitatory transmission through the hippocampus. 2. Most cells (49/74) could fire a burst discharge, a portion of which was Ca2+ dependent, in response to direct depolarization or in response to orthodromic or antidromic activation. Other cells (23/74) could not be made to burst, but instead fired single repetitive spikes when directly depolarized or single spikes in response to orthodromic or antidromic activation. Two recorded cells appeared to be interneurons and differed from bursting and non-bursting cells in action-potential shape and response to extracellular stimulation. 3. Bursting cells differed from nonbursting cells in their membrane properties: 1) their time constants were typically shorter (averaging 7.4 ms for bursting cells and 11.5 ms for nonbursting cells), 2) they exhibited a pronounced "sag" in the potential response to hyperpolarizing current injection, and 3) they responded at the break of a hyperpolarizing stimulus with a depolarization (anodal break potential). The sag and the anodal break potential were not detected in recordings from nonbursting neurons. 4. A single-spiking mode could be induced in bursting cells by depolarization from resting potential to about -60 mV. Conversely, hyperpolarization of nonbursting cells did not convert them to bursting cells. 5. Both bursting and nonbursting cell types could be antidromically driven. Whereas both excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs and IPSPs) were prominent in nonbursting cells, IPSPs were observed at a lower stimulus intensities than EPSPs in most cells. EPSPs were evident in bursting cells and they triggered burst discharges. IPSPs in bursting cells were detected only when these cells were depolarized, eliminating burst responses. 6. Spontaneous firing rates were low (averaging {\textless} 1 spike/s) for both cell types. Addition of picrotoxin produced spontaneous burst or EPSP responses in bursting cells, synchronous with different patterns of picrotoxin-induced population bursts originating in CA3 and/or entorhinal cortex. Individual subicular cells followed CA3 or entorhinal cortex or both. No such activity was recorded in nonbursting cells. No increases in activity in either cell type were seen after picrotoxin application to isolated pieces of subicular cortex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

The subiculum is the primary hippocampal formation output area and  is comparatively uninvestigated neurophysiologically. We compared subicular  unit activity and the subicular EEG while rats occupied a small, restricted  environment and also correlated neuronal activity with the ongoing behavior of  the animal. Units were separated using their electrophysiological  characteristics into bursting units, regular spiking units, theta-modulated  units, and fast spiking units. The bursting and regular spiking unit classes  are similar to hippocampal CA1 units, whereas the fast spiking units appear to  be interneurons. Bursting units were variable in their behavior: some units  bursted regularly, and others bursted only occasionally. Theta-modulated units  have not been described before; these were similar to regular spiking units in  all respects except that they increased their firing significantly when theta  oscillations were present in the simultaneous EEG record. Subicular EEG was  similar to hippocampal EEG, with theta oscillations dominating “alert,  moving” behaviors, while large amplitude irregular activity (LIA), which  included sharp waves, predominated when theta oscillations were not present,  mainly during “alert, still” and “quiet” behaviors. A  relatively small proportion of subicular recordings (approximately 32\%) were  phase-locked to theta; this is a smaller proportion than in areas from which  the subiculum takes major inputs. The relative lack of entrainment of  subicular neurons by this important intrinsic rhythm is suggestive of a limit  to which theta might be capable of affecting both subicular and hippocampal  information processing more generally.},

	abstract = {The neuronal population vector (NPV) for movement direction is the sum of weighted neuronal directional contributions. Based on theoretical considerations, we proposed recently that the sharpness of tuning will impact the directional precision, accuracy, and length of the NPV, such that sharper tuning will yield NPV with higher precision, higher accuracy, and shorter length (Mahan and Georgopoulos in Front Neural Circuits 7:92, 2013). Furthermore, we proposed that controlling the inhibitory drive in a local network could be the mechanism by which the sharpness of directional tuning would be varied, resulting in a continuous specification and control of movement’s directional precision, accuracy, and speed (Mahan and Georgopoulos in Front Neural Circuits 7:92, 2013, Fig. 5). As a first step in testing this idea, here we analyzed data from 899 cells recorded in the motor cortex during performance of a center → out task. There were two major findings. First, directional selectivity varied with cell activity, such that it was higher in cells with lower mean discharge rates. And second, NPVs calculated from subsets of cells with higher directional selectivity (and, correspondingly, lower mean discharge rates) were more accurate (i.e., closer to the movement), precise (i.e., less variable), and shorter (i.e., slower; Schwartz in Science 265:540–542, 1994). These findings confirm our predictions above made from modeling (Mahan and Georgopoulos in Front Neural Circuits 7:92, 2013) and provide a simple mechanism by which desired attributes of the directional motor command can be implemented. We hypothesize that the inhibitory drive in a local network is controlled directly and independently of recurrent collaterals or common excitatory inputs to other cells. This could be achieved by a private excitation/inhibition of key inhibitory interneurons in a way similar to that in operation for Renshaw cells in the spinal cord. The presence of such a private line of inhibitory control remains to be investigated.},

We used this setup to generate a publicly-available dataset where a cortical neuron’s spiking activity is recorded in patch-clamp next to a dense CMOS Neuropixels probe. “Ground-truth” datasets of this kind are rare but valuable to the neuroscience community, as they power the development and improvement of spike-sorting and analysis algorithms, tethering them to empirical observations. In this article, we describe our approach and report exploratory and descriptive analysis on the resulting dataset. We study the detectability of patch-clamp spikes on the extracellular probe, within-unit reliability of spike features and spatiotemporal dynamics of the action potential waveform. We open discussion and collaboration on this dataset through an online repository, with a view to producing follow-up publications.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Prologue{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Our efforts to record from the same neuron in vivo using patch-clamp and dense extracellular probes have resulted in three outputs: a publicly-available dataset (http://bit.ly/paired\_recs), a manuscript, and a code repository (http://bit.ly/paired\_git). Together, these three components form the publication arising from the experiments we have performed. The role of the dataset is to be downloaded and re-used. The role of the manuscript is to describe the experimental methods through which we acquired the dataset, explain it and showcase which types of questions it can be used to address. The repository has two roles: first, promoting reproducibility and error correction. By making our analysis and figure-generation code freely-available, we wish to make our analysis procedures clear and enable the reader to reproduce our results from the raw data, alerting us to any potential mistakes. Second, the repository will form a living, dynamic and interactive component of the publication: a forum for open collaboration on this dataset. Any interested scientists can contribute to it, joining us in detailed exploration of these recordings with a view to producing follow-up publications in which they will be credited for their input.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Why did we opt to publish this way? The first reason is that the very nature of the project we here describe – recording the same neuron with patch-clamp and extracellular probes – invites an open science and open source approach. This is because the primary use of this type of “ground truth” validation data is to aid the development of new sorting and analysis algorithms, as well as to benchmark and improve existing ones. The second reason is that despite being conceptually very simple, this project generated a large and complex dataset that can be tackled in many ways and used to address different types of question. Some of these questions are beyond the reach of our analytical expertise; others lie even beyond the scope of our scientific imagination. By releasing the dataset and providing a repository for scientific discussion and collaboration, we aim to maximise its scientific return to the community. Instead of having each interested research group work in isolation, we hope that by encouraging collaboration and discussion between peers we can foster synergy between them that will lead to work of greater scientific value.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Although datasets like ours are exquisitely suited for such an approach, we believe this publication strategy needs to become more widely adopted in neuroscience. We were pleased to note recent publications spontaneously and independently using similar approaches$^{\textrm{1-4}}$, in what may well be evidence of convergent thinking. Perhaps the time has come for new publication and collaboration paradigms. We will elaborate on this subject during the Epilogue. For now, let us get back to electrophysiological recordings, before we begin an experiment on scientific collaboration.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Second, they need to be as efficient as possible, since the number of trials available in a set of neural recording is usually limited by experimental constraints. Traditionally, cross-validated decoding has been used as a reliability measure, but it only provides a lower bound on reliability and underestimates reliability substantially in small datasets. We show that, if the number of trials per condition is larger than the number of neurons, there is an alternative, direct estimate of reliability which consistently leads to smaller errors and is much faster to compute. The superior performance of the direct estimator is evident both for simulated data and for neuronal population recordings from macaque primary visual cortex. Furthermore we propose generalizations of the direct estimator which measure changes in stimulus encoding across conditions and the impact of correlations on encoding and decoding, typically denoted by Ishuffle and Idiag respectively.},

	abstract = {Most sensory, cognitive and motor functions depend on the interactions of many neurons. In recent years, there has been rapid development and increasing use of technologies for recording from large numbers of neurons, either sequentially or simultaneously. A key question is what scientific insight can be gained by studying a population of recorded neurons beyond studying each neuron individually. Here, we examine three important motivations for population studies: single-trial hypotheses requiring statistical power, hypotheses of population response structure and exploratory analyses of large data sets. Many recent studies have adopted dimensionality reduction to analyze these populations and to find features that are not apparent at the level of individual neurons. We describe the dimensionality reduction methods commonly applied to population activity and offer practical advice about selecting methods and interpreting their outputs. This review is intended for experimental and computational researchers who seek to understand the role dimensionality reduction has had and can have in systems neuroscience, and who seek to apply these methods to their own data.},

There is a growing need for statistical methods to study the interaction among multiple, labeled populations of neurons. Rather than attempting to identify direct interactions between neurons (where the number of interactions grows with the number of neurons squared), we propose to extract a smaller number of latent variables from each population and study how these latent variables interact. Speciﬁcally, we propose extensions to probabilistic canonical correlation analysis (pCCA) to capture the temporal structure of the latent variables, as well as to distinguish within-population dynamics from between-population interactions (termed Group Latent Auto-Regressive Analysis, gLARA). We then applied these methods to populations of neurons recorded simultaneously in visual areas V1 and V2, and found that gLARA provides a better description of the recordings than pCCA. This work provides a foundation for studying how multiple populations of neurons interact and how this interaction supports brain function.},

	abstract = {The ability to identify directional interactions that occur among multiple neurons in the brain is crucial to an understanding of how groups of neurons cooperate in order to generate specific brain functions. However, an optimal method of assessing these interactions has not been established. Granger causality has proven to be an effective method for the analysis of the directional interactions between multiple sets of continuous-valued data, but cannot be applied to neural spike train recordings due to their discrete nature. This paper proposes a point process framework that enables Granger causality to be applied to point process data such as neural spike trains. The proposed framework uses the point process likelihood function to relate a neuron's spiking probability to possible covariates, such as its own spiking history and the concurrent activity of simultaneously recorded neurons. Granger causality is assessed based on the relative reduction of the point process likelihood of one neuron obtained excluding one of its covariates compared to the likelihood obtained using all of its covariates. The method was tested on simulated data, and then applied to neural activity recorded from the primary motor cortex (MI) of a Felis catus subject. The interactions present in the simulated data were predicted with a high degree of accuracy, and when applied to the real neural data, the proposed method identified causal relationships between many of the recorded neurons. This paper proposes a novel method that successfully applies Granger causality to point process data, and has the potential to provide unique physiological insights when applied to neural spike trains.},

	abstract = {Advances in recording technologies have given neuroscience researchers access to large amounts of data, in particular, simultaneous, individual recordings of large groups of neurons in different parts of the brain. A variety of quantitative techniques have been utilized to analyze the spiking activities of the neurons to elucidate the functional connectivity of the recorded neurons. In the past, researchers have used correlative measures. More recently, to better capture the dynamic, complex relationships present in the data, neuroscientists have employed causal measures—most of which are variants of Granger causality—with limited success. This paper motivates the directed information, an information and control theoretic concept, as a modality-independent embodiment of Granger's original notion of causality. Key properties include: (a) it is nonzero if and only if one process causally influences another, and (b) its specific value can be interpreted as the strength of a causal relationship. We next describe how the causally conditioned directed information between two processes given knowledge of others provides a network version of causality: it is nonzero if and only if, in the presence of the present and past of other processes, one process causally influences another. This notion is shown to be able to differentiate between true direct causal influences, common inputs, and cascade effects in more two processes. We next describe a procedure to estimate the directed information on neural spike trains using point process generalized linear models, maximum likelihood estimation and information-theoretic model order selection. We demonstrate that on a simulated network of neurons, it (a) correctly identifies all pairwise causal relationships and (b) correctly identifies network causal relationships. This procedure is then used to analyze ensemble spike train recordings in primary motor cortex of an awake monkey while performing target reaching tasks, uncovering causal relationships whose directionality are consistent with predictions made from the wave propagation of simultaneously recorded local field potentials.},

By simultaneously recording local field potential from both the dorsal hippocampus and anatomically connected cerebellar regions, we additionally suggest that the two structures interact, in a behaviorally dynamic manner, through subregion-specific synchronization of neuronal oscillations in the 6–12 Hz frequency range. Together, these results reveal a novel neural network macro-architecture through which we can understand how a brain region classically associated with motor control, the cerebellum, may influence hippocampal neuronal activity and related functions, such as spatial navigation.},

However, studies have reported discrepant findings, providing a confusing picture. Here we briefly review these studies and conduct simulations to explore the influence of several experimental and physiological factors on correlation measurements. Differences in response strength, the time window over which spikes are counted, spike sorting conventions and internal states can all markedly affect measured correlations and systematically bias estimates. Given these complicating factors, we offer guidelines for interpreting correlation data and a discussion of how best to evaluate the effect of correlations on cortical processing.},

As tablets and three-dimensional (3D) applications are developed, 3D atlas applications are utilized in learning anatomy by medical students. The purpose of this research is to investigate the impacts of 3D atlas applications on students' understanding of gross anatomy. This research was targeted at medical students taking the Anatomy and Embryology class in 2017 and 2018, at Ewha Womans University. The correlation between use of 3D atlas and student's results on the Anatomy and Embryology test was analyzed. An open-book anatomy quiz was also carried out to analyze the correlation between the type of atlas each student refers to and the results of the quiz. Independent t test between groups did not show statistically significant difference in the results of the Anatomy and Embryology test. However, the group referring to 3D atlas showed significantly higher results on the simple questions of the open-book anatomy quiz (P{\textless}0.05). In conclusion, 3D atlas is not very helpful in acquiring deep anatomical knowledge or memorizing the location of anatomical structures, but it can simply aid in the rapid identification of anatomical structures. Additionally, the 3D atlas will show good synergy with the two-dimensional atlas if used properly in anatomy education, because most students think it is useful to use the 3D atlas.},

We present an image registration approach for histology volume reconstruction, which uses a set of optical blockface images. The reconstructed histology volume represents a reliable shape of the processed specimen with no propagated post-processing registration error. The Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E) stained sections of two mouse mammary glands were registered to their corresponding blockface images using boundary points extracted from the edges of the specimen in histology and blockface images. The accuracy of the registration was visually evaluated. The alignment of the macrostructures of the mammary glands was also visually assessed at high resolution. This study delineates the different steps of this image registration pipeline, ranging from excision of the mammary gland through to 3D histology volume reconstruction. While 2D histology images reveal the structural differences between pairs of sections, 3D histology volume provides the ability to visualize the differences in shape and volume of the mammary glands.},

The rules governing plasticity of synaptic transmission in the hippocampal-subicular axis are poorly understood; this axis appears to share some properties in common with the hippocampus proper, but behaves quite differently in other respects. Equally, its functional properties are not well understood; it plays an important but ill-defined role in spatial navigation, mnemonic processing and control of the response to stress. Here, I review investigations of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal-subicular pathway, recordings of subicular neurons in the freely moving behaving animal, the effects of behavioural and other stressors on subicular synaptic plasticity, and anatomical data on the dorso-ventral organization of the subiculum in relation to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. I argue that there is a dorso-ventral segregation of function within the subiculum: the dorsal component appears principally concerned with the processing of information about space, movement and memory, whereas the ventral component appears to play a major regulatory role in the inhibition of the HPA axis.},

	abstract = {The principal goal of the proposed project is to develop a data analysis framework that incorporates analytical methods for the study of cognitive map represented by neurons in vivo recorded from chronically implanted freely behaving rodents. Where and how spatial information is represented in the brain has long been studied since O'Keefe and Dostrovsky (1971) first described the spatial receptive fields in hippocampal neurons (O'Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971). The discovery of grid cells- neurons with multiple such receptive fields arranged in a triangular grid, in entorhinal cortex(Hafting et al., 2005) led to the discovery of an internal navigation system in the brain (Moser et al., 2008). Moreover, neurons tuned to non-spatial, natural stimuli (e.g. speed-cells, etc.), have also been described, and are likely to contribute to the dynamic representations of 'self-location', e.g. for path integration (Kropff et al., 2015). Recently, other brain areas contributing to this navigation system have also been explored with novel experiment designs in chronically implanted rodents (Jankowski et al., 2014). This approach can generate vast amounts of data, particularly if acquired over a long duration, i.e. to validate the stability of recordings and to test different experimental manipulations (Jankowski et al., 2014). Moreover, advances in the design of electrodes, i.e. increasing the density (and therefore, the number of recording sites), have, and will continue to increase the amount of generated data exponentially in the coming years (Rey et al., 2015). The process of analysing such large data sets involves first identifying the activities of single-neurons from the noisy recorded data using unsupervised machine learning techniques, second, the analysis of relationships with spatial and non-spatial variables and verifying the correlations, and finally, the computation of inferential statistics for the description of local cell population. There are some open-source software packages for studying neural codes of single-neurons, multi-neurons, and local field potential (Rey et al., 2015, Ince, 2013), however, at present, there is no toolbox, so far we know, to explore neuronal encoding of spatial and non-spatial information relevant to cognitive mapping that also incorporates batch processing of large amounts of data. Individual laboratories have been using established analyses while new ones evolve, but there is no software that implements these algorithms within one working environment, which limits the wide applications of these methods. Moreover, it is also necessary to facilitate quick implementation and integration of new techniques along with the established ones given the challenges associated with evolution of new technology. In this project we developed NeuroChaT (Neuron Characterization Toolbox), a graphical user interface (GUI)-based open-source software suit that will bring together the existing algorithms and analysis methods in a unified framework for greater accessibility and to provide a platform for easier implementation of the context-specific techniques. I expect that it will enable the scientific community to focus more on bringing excellence in both developing novel algorithms and experimental designs with an ease of access to a widely used and standard data format much like SPM and BrainVoyager in neuroimaging.},

Cortical activity, for example, is determined in large part by the spike output mode from the thalamus, which is controlled by the gating of low-voltage–activated calcium channels. In the subiculum—the major output of the hippocampus—transitions occur from bursting in the delta-frequency band to single spiking in the theta-frequency band. We show here that these transitions are influenced strongly by the inactivation kinetics of voltage-gated sodium channels. Prolonged inactivation of sodium channels is responsible for an activity-dependent switch from bursting to single spiking, constituting a novel mechanism through which network dynamics are controlled by ion channel gating.},

Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of boundary vector cells (BVC) in the subiculum, as well as exceptional stability during recordings conducted in the dark, suggesting that the subiculum is involved in the coding of allocentric cues and also in path integration. In order to better understand the role of the subiculum in spatial processing and the coding of external cues, we recorded subicular units in freely moving rats while performing two experiments: the “size experiment” in which we modified the arena size, and the “barrier experiment” in which we inserted new barriers in a familiar open field thus dividing the enclosure into four comparable sub-chambers. We hypothesized that if physical boundaries were deterministic of the firing of subicular units a strong spatial replication pattern would be found in most spatially modulated units. In contrast, our results demonstrate heterogeneous space coding by different cell types: place cells, barrier-related units and BVC.

The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

I focus specifically on cognitive schemata in perception and memory, confirmation bias, systematic misunderstanding of statistics, and asymmetry in moral judgements of errors of commission and omission. Finally, I consider methods that may help mitigate the effects of cognitive constraints: better training, including use of simulations to overcome statistical misunderstanding, specific programs directed at inoculating against cognitive biases, adoption of Registered Reports to encourage more critical reflection in planning studies, and using methods such as triangulation and "pre mortem" evaluation of study design to make a culture of criticism more acceptable.},

The local field potential (LFP) reflects activity of many neurons in the vicinity of the recording electrode and is therefore useful for studying local network dynamics. Much of the nature of the LFP is, however, still unknown. There are, for instance, contradicting reports on the spatial extent of the region generating the LFP. Here, we use a detailed biophysical modeling approach to investigate the size of the contributing region by simulating the LFP from a large number of neurons around the electrode. We find that the size of the generating region depends on the neuron morphology, the synapse distribution, and the correlation in synaptic activity. For uncorrelated activity, the LFP represents cells in a small region (within a radius of a few hundred micrometers). If the LFP contributions from different cells are correlated, the size of the generating region is determined by the spatial extent of the correlated activity.},

This is a composite signal that receives contributions from multiple neural sources, yet interpreting its nature and significance may be hindered by several confounding factors and technical limitations. By and large, the main factor defining the amplitude of LFPs is the geometry of the current sources, over and above the degree of synchronization or the properties of the media. As such, similar levels of activity may result in potentials that differ in several orders of magnitude in different populations. The geometry of these sources has been experimentally inaccessible until intracerebral high density recordings enabled the co-activating sources to be revealed. Without this information, it has proven difficult to interpret a century's worth of recordings that used temporal cues alone, such as event or spike related potentials and frequency bands. Meanwhile, a collection of biophysically ill-founded concepts have been considered legitimate, which can now be corrected in the light of recent advances. The relationship of LFPs to their sources is often counterintuitive. For instance, most LFP activity is not local but remote, it may be larger further from rather than close to the source, the polarity does not define its excitatory or inhibitory nature, and the amplitude may increase when source's activity is reduced. As technological developments foster the use of LFPs, the time is now ripe to raise awareness of the need to take into account spatial aspects of these signals and of the errors derived from neglecting to do so.},

We investigated this contribution in multi-electrode array recordings from human and monkey neocortex by examining the spike-triggered LFP average (st-LFP). The resulting st-LFPs were dominated by broad spatio-temporal components due to ongoing activity, synaptic inputs and recurrent connectivity. To reduce the spatial reach of the st-LFP and observe the local field related to a single spike we applied a spatial filter, whose weights were adapted to the covariance of ongoing LFP. The filtered st-LFPs were limited to the perimeter of 800 μm around the neuron, and propagated at axonal speed, which is consistent with their unitary nature. In addition, we discriminated between putative inhibitory and excitatory neurons and found that the inhibitory st-LFP peaked at shorter latencies, consistently with previous findings in hippocampal slices. Thus, in human and monkey neocortex, the LFP reflects primarily inhibitory neuron activity.},

At the same time, there exist few general theories or principles that explain brain function. We attribute this disparity, in part, to limitations in current methodologies. Traditional neurophysiological approaches record the activities of one neuron or a few neurons at a time. Neurochemical approaches focus on single neurotransmitters. Yet, there is an increasing realization that neural circuits operate at emergent levels, where the interactions between hundreds or thousands of neurons, utilizing multiple chemical transmitters, generate functional states. Brains function at the nanoscale, so tools to study brains must ultimately operate at this scale, as well. Nanoscience and nanotechnology are poised to provide a rich toolkit of novel methods to explore brain function by enabling simultaneous measurement and manipulation of activity of thousands or even millions of neurons. We and others refer to this goal as the Brain Activity Mapping Project. In this Nano Focus, we discuss how recent developments in nanoscale analysis tools and in the design and synthesis of nanomaterials have generated optical, electrical, and chemical methods that can readily be adapted for use in neuroscience. These approaches represent exciting areas of technical development and research.

To address this gap, we have developed an unsupervised method to identify internal states from behavioral data, and have applied it to the study of a dynamic social interaction. During courtship, \textit{Drosophila melanogaster} males pattern their songs using feedback cues from their partner. Our model uncovers three latent states underlying this behavior, and is able to predict the moment-to-moment variation in natural song patterning decisions. These distinct behavioral states correspond to different sensorimotor strategies, each of which is characterized by different mappings from feedback cues to song modes. Using the model, we show that a pair of neurons previously thought to be command neurons for song production are sufficient to drive switching between states. Our results reveal how animals compose behavior from previously unidentified internal states, a necessary step for quantitative descriptions of animal behavior that link environmental cues, internal needs, neuronal activity, and motor outputs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Neural population analyses often reduce the data dimensionality to focus on relevant activity patterns. A major hurdle to data analysis is spike sorting, and this problem is growing as the number of recorded neurons increases. Here, we investigate whether spike sorting is necessary to estimate neural population dynamics. The theory of random projections suggests that we can accurately estimate the geometry of low-dimensional manifolds from a small number of linear projections of the data. We recorded data using Neuropixels probes in motor cortex of nonhuman primates and reanalyzed data from three previous studies and found that neural dynamics and scientific conclusions are quite similar using multiunit threshold crossings rather than sorted neurons.

The first proposition was that brain networks support a set of reflex responses, with current sensory inputs producing immediate motor outputs. The behaviorist paradigm suggested that actions can always be explained as a response to immediate external cues. In response to these views, the cognitive paradigm argued that behavior cannot be understood simply as input–output functions because the hidden layers of brain generate unpredictability. The central processing was termed “cognition.” Here we propose a neuroscience-based model of cognition. Our core hypothesis is that cognition depends on internal models of the animal and its world, where internally generated sequences can serve to perform “what if” scenarios and anticipate the possible consequences of alternative actions without actually testing them, and aid in the decisions of overt actions. We support our hypotheses by several examples of recent experimental findings and show how externally guided cell assembly sequences become internalized to support cognitive functions.},

The aim of this program is causal explanation through neural manipulations that allow testing of necessity and sufficiency claims. We argue, however, that another equally important approach seeks an alternative form of understanding through careful theoretical and experimental decomposition of behavior. Specifically, the detailed analysis of tasks and of the behavior they elicit is best suited for discovering component processes and their underlying algorithms. In most cases, we argue that study of the neural implementation of behavior is best investigated after such behavioral work. Thus, we advocate a more pluralistic notion of neuroscience when it comes to the brain-behavior relationship: behavioral work provides understanding, whereas neural interventions test causality.},

This familiar understanding grounds the conviction that a cell's organization can be explained reductionistically, as well as the idea that its molecular pathways can be construed as deterministic circuits. The machine conception of the cell owes a great deal of its success to the methods traditionally used in molecular biology. However, the recent introduction of novel experimental techniques capable of tracking individual molecules within cells in real time is leading to the rapid accumulation of data that are inconsistent with an engineering view of the cell. This paper examines four major domains of current research in which the challenges to the machine conception of the cell are particularly pronounced: cellular architecture, protein complexes, intracellular transport, and cellular behaviour. It argues that a new theoretical understanding of the cell is emerging from the study of these phenomena which emphasizes the dynamic, self-organizing nature of its constitution, the fluidity and plasticity of its components, and the stochasticity and non-linearity of its underlying processes.},

Yet our knowledge about the diversity of neuronal morphology, in particular its distant axonal projections, is still extremely limited. To systematically obtain single neuron full morphology on a brain-wide scale in mice, we established a pipeline that encompasses five major components: sparse labeling, whole-brain imaging, reconstruction, registration, and classification. We achieved sparse, robust and consistent fluorescent labeling of a wide range of neuronal types across the mouse brain in an efficient way by combining transgenic or viral Cre delivery with novel transgenic reporter lines, and generated a large set of high-resolution whole-brain fluorescent imaging datasets containing thousands of reconstructable neurons using the fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography (fMOST) system. We developed a set of software tools based on the visualization and analysis suite, Vaa3D, for large-volume image data processing and computation-assisted morphological reconstruction. In a proof-of-principle case, we reconstructed full morphologies of 96 neurons from the claustrum and cortex that belong to a single transcriptomically-defined neuronal subclass. We developed a data-driven clustering approach to classify them into multiple morphological and projection types, suggesting that these neurons work in a targeted and coordinated manner to process cortical information. Imaging data and the new computational reconstruction tools are publicly available to enable community-based efforts towards large-scale full morphology reconstruction of neurons throughout the entire mouse brain.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here we demonstrate a novel, within-subject instrumental lever-pressing paradigm, in which mice shift between goal-directed and habitual actions. We identify a role for orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in actions following outcome revaluation, and confirm that dorsal medial (DMS) and lateral striatum (DLS) mediate different action strategies. Simultaneous in vivo recordings of OFC, DMS and DLS neuronal ensembles during shifting reveal that the same neurons display different activities depending on whether presses are goal-directed or habitual, with DMS and OFC becoming more and DLS less engaged during goal-directed actions. Importantly, the magnitude of neural activity changes in OFC following changes in outcome value positively correlates with the level of goal-directed behavior. Chemogenetic inhibition of OFC disrupts goal-directed actions, whereas optogenetic activation of OFC specifically increases goal-directed pressing. These results also reveal a role for OFC in action revaluation, which has implications for understanding compulsive behavior.},

Here, we have simultaneously characterized single-unit activity and local field potential (LFP) dynamics in the S1, primary visual cortex (V1), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), posterior parietal cortex (PPC), while freely moving rats performed an active tactile discrimination task. Simultaneous single unit recordings from all these cortical regions revealed statistically significant neuronal firing rate modulations during all task phases (anticipatory, discrimination, response, and reward). Meanwhile, phase analysis of pairwise LFP recordings revealed the occurrence of long-range synchronization across the sampled fronto-parieto-occipital cortical areas during tactile sampling. Causal analysis of the same pairwise recorded LFPs demonstrated the occurrence of complex dynamic interactions between cortical areas throughout the fronto-parietal-occipital loop. These interactions changed significantly between cortical regions as a function of frequencies (i.e. beta, theta and gamma) and according to the different phases of the behavioral task. Overall, these findings indicate that active tactile discrimination by rats is characterized by much more widespread and dynamic complex interactions within the fronto-parieto-occipital cortex than previously anticipated.},

Indeed, neurons in the hippocampus and other brain regions critical to episodic memory code for the passage of time at a range of time scales. The origin of this temporal signal, however, remains unclear. Here, we examined temporal responses in the entorhinal cortex of macaque monkeys as they viewed complex images. Many neurons in the entorhinal cortex were responsive to image onset, showing large deviations from baseline firing shortly after image onset but relaxing back to baseline at different rates. This range of relaxation rates allowed for the time since image onset to be decoded on the scale of seconds. Further, the ensemble carried information about image content suggesting that neurons in the entorhinal cortex carry information not only about when an event took place but also the identity of that event. Taken together, these findings suggest that the primate entorhinal cortex uses a spectrum of time constants to construct a temporal record of the past in support of episodic memory.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Decision making is often driven by the subjective value of available options, a value which is formed through experience. To support this fundamental behavior, the brain must encode and maintain the subjective value. To investigate the area specificity and plasticity of value coding, we trained mice in a value-based decision task and imaged neural activity in 6 cortical areas with cellular resolution. History- and value-related signals were widespread across areas, but their strength and temporal patterns differed. In expert mice, the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) uniquely encoded history- and value-related signals with persistent population activity patterns across trials. This unique encoding of RSC emerged during task learning with a strong increase in more distant history signals. Acute inactivation of RSC selectively impaired the reward-history-based behavioral strategy. Our results indicate that RSC flexibly changes its history coding and persistently encodes value-related signals to support adaptive behaviors.},

	abstract = {Many neurons in the rat lateral mammillary nuclei (LMN) fire selectively in relation to the animal's head direction (HD) in the horizontal plane independent of the rat's location or behavior. One hypothesis of how this representation is generated and updated is via subcortical projections from the dorsal tegmental nucleus (DTN). Here we report the type of activity in DTN neurons. The majority of cells (75\%) fired as a function of the rat's angular head velocity (AHV). Cells exhibited one of two types of firing patterns: (1) symmetric, in which the firing rate was positively correlated with AHV during head turns in both directions, and (2) asymmetric, in which the firing rate was positively correlated with head turns in one direction and correlated either negatively or not at all in the opposite direction. In addition to modulation by AHV, some of the AHV cells (40.1\%) were weakly modulated by the rat's linear velocity, and a smaller number were modulated by HD (11\%) or head pitch (15.9\%). Autocorrelation analyses indicated that with the head stationary, AHV cells displayed irregular discharge patterns. Because afferents from the DTN are the major source of information projecting to the LMN, these results suggest that AHV information from the DTN plays a significant role in generating the HD signal in LMN. A model is proposed showing how DTN AHV cells can generate and update the LMN HD cell signal.},

Their firing is also strongly theta modulated, firing primarily at the negative-to-positive phase of the locally recorded theta wave. TPD theta modulation is significantly stronger than that of place cells. In contrast, the firing of head-direction cells is not modulated by theta at all.

	abstract = {An understanding of the in vivo spatial emergence of abnormal brain activity during spontaneous seizure onset is critical to future early seizure detection and closed-loop seizure prevention therapies. In this study, we use Granger causality (GC) to determine the strength and direction of relationships between local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from bilateral microelectrode arrays in an intermittent spontaneous seizure model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy before, during, and after Racine grade partial onset generalized seizures. Our results indicate distinct patterns of directional GC relationships within the hippocampus, specifically from the CA1 subfield to the dentate gryus, prior to and during seizure onset. Our results suggest sequential and hierarchical temporal relationships between the CA1 and dentate gyrus within and across hippocampal hemispheres during seizure. Additionally, our analysis suggests a reversal in the direction of GC relationships during seizure, from an abnormal pattern to more anatomically expected pattern. This reversal correlates well with the observed behavioral transition from tonic to clonic seizure in time-locked video. These findings highlight the utility of GC to reveal dynamic directional temporal relationships between multichannel LFP recordings from multiple brain regions during unprovoked spontaneous seizures.},

In particular, the point process - generalized linear model (PP-GLM) framework has been applied successfully to problems ranging from neuro-endocrine physiology to neural decoding. However, the lack of freely distributed software implementations of published PP-GLM algorithms together with problem-specific modifications required for their use, limit wide application of these techniques. In an effort to make existing PP-GLM methods more accessible to the neuroscience community, we have developed nSTAT--an open source neural spike train analysis toolbox for Matlab®. By adopting an object-oriented programming (OOP) approach, nSTAT allows users to easily manipulate data by performing operations on objects that have an intuitive connection to the experiment (spike trains, covariates, etc.), rather than by dealing with data in vector/matrix form. The algorithms implemented within nSTAT address a number of common problems including computation of peri-stimulus time histograms, quantification of the temporal response properties of neurons, and characterization of neural plasticity within and across trials. nSTAT provides a starting point for exploratory data analysis, allows for simple and systematic building and testing of point process models, and for decoding of stimulus variables based on point process models of neural function. By providing an open-source toolbox, we hope to establish a platform that can be easily used, modified, and extended by the scientific community to address limitations of current techniques and to extend available techniques to more complex problems.},

	abstract = {Neuroscientists use many different software tools to acquire, analyse and visualise electrophysiological signals. However, incompatible data models and file formats make it difficult to exchange data between these tools. This reduces scientific productivity, renders potentially useful analysis methods inaccessible and impedes collaboration between labs.A common representation of the core data would improve interoperability and facilitate data-sharing.To that end, we propose here a language-independent object model, named "Neo", suitable for representing data acquired from electroencephalographic, intracellular, or extracellular recordings, or generated from simulations. As a concrete instantiation of this object model we have developed an open source implementation in the Python programming language.In addition to representing electrophysiology data in memory for the purposes of analysis and visualisation, the Python implementation provides a set of input/output (IO) modules for reading/writing the data from/to a variety of commonly used file formats.Support is included for formats produced by most of the major manufacturers of electrophysiology recording equipment and also for more generic formats such as MATLAB.Data representation and data analysis are conceptually separate: it is easier to write robust analysis code if it is focused on analysis and relies on an underlying package to handle data representation.For that reason, and also to be as lightweight as possible, the Neo object model and the associated Python package are deliberately limited to representation of data, with no functions for data analysis or visualisation.Software for neurophysiology data analysis and visualisation built on top of Neo automatically gains the benefits of interoperability, easier data sharing and automatic format conversion; there is already a burgeoning ecosystem of such tools. We intend that Neo should become the standard basis for Python tools in neurophysiology.},

The linear relationship between the phase of the spikes and the travel distance within the place field is independent of the animal's running speed. This invariance of the phase–distance relationship is likely to be important for coordinated activity of hippocampal cells and space coding, yet the mechanism responsible for it is not known. Here we show that at faster running speeds place cells are active for fewer θ cycles but oscillate at a higher frequency and emit more spikes per cycle. As a result, the phase shift of spikes from cycle to cycle (i.e., temporal precession slope) is faster, yet spatial-phase precession stays unchanged. Interneurons can also show transient-phase precession and contribute to the formation of coherently precessing assemblies. We hypothesize that the speed-correlated acceleration of place cell assembly oscillation is responsible for the phase–distance invariance of hippocampal place cells.},

Over a century of behavioural research on spatial navigation in humans and animals has greatly increased our understanding of how this highly complex feat is achieved. In turn this has inspired half a century of electrophysiological spatial navigation and memory research which has further advanced our understanding of the brain. In particular, three functional cell types have been suggested to underlie cognitive mapping processes; place cells, head direction cells and grid cells. However, there are numerous other spatially modulated neurons in the brain. For a more complete understanding of the electrophysiological systems and behavioural processes underlying spatial navigation we must also examine these lesser understood neurons. In this review we will briefly summarise the literature surrounding place cells, head direction cells, grid cells and the evidence that these cells collectively form the neural basis of a cognitive map. We will then review literature covering many other spatially modulated neurons in the brain that perhaps further augment this cognitive map.},

Little is known, however, about the information represented in these nuclei. To redress this deficit, we recorded units in three rostral thalamic nuclei in freely-moving rats [the parataenial nucleus (PT), the anteromedial nucleus (AM) and nucleus reuniens NRe]. We found units in these nuclei possessing previously unsuspected spatial properties. The various cell types show clear similarities to place cells, head direction cells, and perimeter/border cells described in hippocampal and parahippocampal regions. Based on their connectivity, it had been predicted that the anterior thalamic nuclei process information with high spatial and temporal resolution while the midline nuclei have more diffuse roles in attention and arousal. Our current findings strongly support the first prediction but directly challenge or substantially moderate the second prediction. The rostral thalamic spatial cells described here may reflect direct hippocampal/parahippocampal inputs, a striking finding of itself, given the relative lack of place cells in other sites receiving direct hippocampal formation inputs. Alternatively, they may provide elemental thalamic spatial inputs to assist hippocampal spatial computations. Finally, they could represent a parallel spatial system in the brain.},

In such networks, representations can be reactivated reliably from subsets of the cues that were present when the memory was encoded, at the same time as interference from competing representations is minimized. Theoretical studies have pointed to the recurrent CA3 system of the hippocampus as a possible attractor network3,4. Consistent with predictions from these studies, experiments have shown that place representations in CA3 and downstream CA1 tolerate small changes in the configuration of the environment but switch to uncorrelated representations when dissimilarities become larger5,6,7,8,9. However, the kinetics supporting such network transitions, at the subsecond timescale, is poorly understood. Here we show in rats that instantaneous transformation of the spatial context does not change the hippocampal representation all at once but is followed by temporary bistability in the discharge activity of CA3 ensembles. Rather than sliding through a continuum of intermediate activity states, the CA3 network undergoes a short period of competitive flickering between preformed representations of the past and present environment before settling on the latter. Network flickers are extremely fast, often with complete replacement of the active ensemble from one theta cycle to the next. Within individual cycles, segregation is stronger towards the end, when firing starts to decline, pointing to the theta cycle as a temporal unit for expression of attractor states in the hippocampus. Repetition of pattern-completion processes across successive theta cycles may facilitate error correction and enhance discriminative power in the presence of weak and ambiguous input cues.},

Existing extracellular probes record neural activity with excellent spatial and temporal (sub-millisecond) resolution, but from only a few dozen neurons per shank. Optical Ca2+ imaging3,4,5 offers more coverage but lacks the temporal resolution needed to distinguish individual spikes reliably and does not measure local field potentials. Until now, no technology compatible with use in unrestrained animals has combined high spatiotemporal resolution with large volume coverage. Here we design, fabricate and test a new silicon probe known as Neuropixels to meet this need. Each probe has 384 recording channels that can programmably address 960 complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) processing-compatible low-impedance TiN6 sites that tile a single 10-mm long, 70 × 20-μm cross-section shank. The 6 × 9-mm probe base is fabricated with the shank on a single chip. Voltage signals are filtered, amplified, multiplexed and digitized on the base, allowing the direct transmission of noise-free digital data from the probe. The combination of dense recording sites and high channel count yielded well-isolated spiking activity from hundreds of neurons per probe implanted in mice and rats. Using two probes, more than 700 well-isolated single neurons were recorded simultaneously from five brain structures in an awake mouse. The fully integrated functionality and small size of Neuropixels probes allowed large populations of neurons from several brain structures to be recorded in freely moving animals. This combination of high-performance electrode technology and scalable chip fabrication methods opens a path towards recording of brain-wide neural activity during behaviour.},

When animals move, activity is translated between grid cells in accordance with the animal's displacement in the environment. For this translation to occur, grid cells must have continuous access to information about instantaneous running speed. However, a powerful entorhinal speed signal has not been identified. Here we show that running speed is represented in the firing rate of a ubiquitous but functionally dedicated population of entorhinal neurons distinct from other cell populations of the local circuit, such as grid, head-direction and border cells. These 'speed cells' are characterized by a context-invariant positive, linear response to running speed, and share with grid cells a prospective bias of ∼50-80 ms. Our observations point to speed cells as a key component of the dynamic representation of self-location in the medial entorhinal cortex.},

	abstract = {In recent years multichannel neuronal signal acquisition systems have allowed scientists to focus on research questions which were otherwise impossible. They act as a powerful means to study brain (dys)functions in in-vivo and in in-vitro animal models. Typically, each session of electrophysiological experiments with multichannel data acquisition systems generate large amount of raw data. For example, a 128 channel signal acquisition system with 16 bits A/D conversion and 20 kHz sampling rate will generate approximately 17 GB data per hour (uncompressed). This poses an important and challenging problem of inferring conclusions from the large amounts of acquired data. Thus, automated signal processing and analysis tools are becoming a key component in neuroscience research, facilitating extraction of relevant information from neuronal recordings in a reasonable time. The purpose of this review is to introduce the reader to the current state-of-the-art of open-source packages for (semi)automated processing and analysis of multichannel extracellular neuronal signals (i.e., neuronal spikes, local field potentials, electroencephalogram, etc.), and the existing Neuroinformatics infrastructure for tool and data sharing. The review is concluded by pinpointing some major challenges that are to be faced, which include the development of novel benchmarking techniques, cloud-based distributed processing and analysis tools, as well as defining novel means to share and standardize data.},

Because these cell types have some of the most conspicuous behavioral correlates among neurons in nonsensory cortical systems, and because their spatial firing structure reflects computations internally in the system, studies of entorhinal-hippocampal representations may offer considerable insight into general principles of cortical network dynamics.},

Based on their baseline firing rate, we identified a subpopulation of head-direction cells that drastically decreased its firing rate as a response to stress while preserving their head directionality. The remaining population of head-direction cells as well as other neurons recorded in the postsubiculum were unaffected.

The modification of synapses and neuronal circuits through plasticity is thought to underlie memory formation2. The induction of synaptic plasticity is favoured by coordinated action-potential timing across populations of neurons3. Such coordinated activity of neural populations can give rise to oscillations of different frequencies, recorded in local field potentials. Brain oscillations in the theta frequency range (3–8 Hz) are often associated with the favourable induction of synaptic plasticity as well as behavioural memory4. Here we report the activity of single neurons recorded together with the local field potential in humans engaged in a learning task. We show that successful memory formation in humans is predicted by a tight coordination of spike timing with the local theta oscillation. More stereotyped spiking predicts better memory, as indicated by higher retrieval confidence reported by subjects. These findings provide a link between the known modulation of theta oscillations by many memory-modulating behaviours and circuit mechanisms of plasticity.},

To understand how this signal might be generated, one useful step is to discover what other cell types, in addition to the head direction cells, may exist in the postsubiculum, since these cells might be involved in helping to generate the direction-specific activity. Here postsubicular cells were recorded as animals navigated in a cylindrical recording chamber. It was found that, in addition to head direction cells, the postsubiculum contains cells that show several other types of spatial/behavioral correlates, including angular velocity of the head, running speed, and location. Ten percent of the cells were classified as angular velocity cells, and they resembled vestibular afferent fibers, with antagonistic responses to clockwise versus counterclockwise turns. In addition, numerous other cell types were observed. These latter cells were harder to classify, but all showed a significant correlation with one or more of the above variables. These findings suggest that the head direction cell signal may be at least partly based on the angular velocity, running speed, and locational signals observed here.},

	abstract = {Cells in several portions of the hippocampal formation show location-related firing, so that the momentary rate of each cell signals the spatial location of a freely moving rat. Insight into how these signals are generated, and how they travel around the hippocampal circuitry, can be gained by examination of the exact timing of the locational signal. Here, this was investigated for both hippocampal and subicular cells. For this, several aspects of the spatial firing pattern of each cell were examined over a series of time shifts, in which spikes were paired with locations occupied by the animal in either the immediate past, present, or future. Results showed that subicular cells appear to anticipate future locations by approximately 50 to 70 msec, on average. In contrast, hippocampal cells were best correlated with positions about 30 to 40 msec in the future. However, this timing, for hippocampal cells only, was related to the average session running speed, so that the cells were correlated with future locations at slow speeds, but lagged behind (were correlated with past locations) at high speeds. These data support the idea that both subicular and hippocampal cells use a path integration mechanism to generate their spatial signal (since both can anticipate future location). For the hippocampal cells the mechanism does not, apparently, take into account speed information, however. Also, the data suggest that the subicular signal cannot be the result of simple transmission of spatial information from the hippocampus to the subiculum, since this would predict that the subicular signal should correlate with later positions than the hippocampal signal.},

Finally, we find that phase locking of prefrontal cells is predicted by the presence of significant correlations with hippocampal cells at positive delays up to 150 ms.

	abstract = {This paper is a study of the behavioral and spatial firing correlates of neurons in the rat postsubiculum. Recordings were made from postsubicular neurons as rats moved freely throughout a cylindrical chamber, where the major cue for orientation was a white card taped to the inside wall. An automatic video/computer system monitored cell discharge while simultaneously tracking the position of 2 colored light emitting diodes (LEDs) secured to the animal's head. The animal's location was calculated from the position of one of the LEDs and head direction in the horizontal plane calculated from the relative positions of the 2 LEDs. Approximately 26\% of the cells were classified as head-direction cells because they discharged as a function of the animal's head direction in the horizontal plane, independent of the animal's behavior, location, or trunk position. For each head-direction cell, vectors drawn in the direction of maximal firing were parallel throughout the recording chamber and did not converge toward a single point. Plots of firing rate versus head direction showed that each firing-rate/head-direction function was adequately described by a triangular function. Each cell's maximum firing rate occurred at only one (the preferred) head direction; firing rates at head directions on either side of the preferred direction decreased linearly with angular deviation from the preferred direction. Results from 24 head-direction cells in 7 animals showed an equal distribution of preferred firing directions over a 360 degrees angle. The peak firing rate of head-direction cells varied from 5 to 115 spikes/sec (mean: 35). The range of head-direction angles over which discharge was elevated (directional firing range) was usually about 90 degrees, with little, if any, discharge at head directions outside this range. Quantitative analysis showed the location of the animal within the cylinder had minimal effect on directional cell firing. For each head-direction cell, the preferred direction, peak firing rate, and directional firing range remained stable for days. These results identify a new cell type that signals the animal's head direction in its environment.},

Traditionally, neurons are analyzed independently on the basis of their tuning to stimuli or movement. Although tuning curve approaches are unaffected by growing numbers of simultaneously recorded neurons, newly developed techniques that analyze interactions between neurons become more accurate and more complex as the number of recorded neurons increases. Emerging data analysis techniques should consider both the computational costs and the potential for more accurate models associated with this exponential growth of the number of recorded neurons.},

	abstract = {The expectancy of a rewarding outcome following actions and cues is coded by a network of brain structures including the orbitofrontal cortex. Thus far, predicted reward was considered to be coded by time-averaged spike rates of neurons. However, besides firing rate, the precise timing of action potentials in relation to ongoing oscillations in local field potentials is thought to be of importance for effective communication between brain areas. We performed multineuron and field potential recordings in orbitofrontal cortex of rats performing olfactory discrimination learning to study the temporal structure of coding predictive of outcome. After associative learning, field potentials were marked by theta oscillations, both in advance and during delivery of reward. Orbitofrontal neurons, especially those coding information about upcoming reward with their firing rate, phase locked to these oscillations in anticipation of reward. When established associations were reversed, phase locking collapsed in the anticipatory task phase, but returned when reward became predictable again after relearning. Behaviorally, the outcome anticipation phase was marked by licking responses, but the frequency of lick responses was dissociated from the strength of theta-band phase locking. The strength of theta-band phase locking by orbitofrontal neurons robustly follows the dynamics of associative learning as measured by behavior and correlates with the rat's current outcome expectancy. Theta-band phase locking may facilitate communication of outcome-related information between reward-related brain areas and offers a novel mechanism for coding value signals during reinforcement learning.},

We examined spiking rhythms and modes of synchrony between neurons participating in head direction networks for evidence of internal processing, independent of direct sensory drive, which may be important for grid cell function. We found that head direction networks of rats were segregated into at least two populations of neurons firing on alternate theta cycles (theta cycle skipping) with fixed synchronous or anti-synchronous relationships. Pairs of anti-synchronous theta cycle skipping neurons exhibited larger differences in head direction tuning, with a minimum difference of 40 degrees of head direction. Septal inactivation preserved the head direction signal, but eliminated theta cycle skipping of head direction cells and grid cell spatial periodicity. We propose that internal mechanisms underlying cycle skipping in head direction networks may be critical for downstream spatial computation by grid cells.},

	abstract = {Across scientific disciplines, there is a rapidly growing recognition of the need for more statistically robust, transparent approaches to data visualization. Complementary to this, many scientists have called for plotting tools that accurately and transparently convey key aspects of statistical effects and raw data with minimal distortion. Previously common approaches, such as plotting conditional mean or median barplots together with error-bars have been criticized for distorting effect size, hiding underlying patterns in the raw data, and obscuring the assumptions upon which the most commonly used statistical tests are based. Here we describe a data visualization approach which overcomes these issues, providing maximal statistical information while preserving the desired ‘inference at a glance’ nature of barplots and other similar visualization devices. These “raincloud plots” can visualize raw data, probability density, and key summary statistics such as median, mean, and relevant confidence intervals in an appealing and flexible format with minimal redundancy. In this tutorial paper, we provide basic demonstrations of the strength of raincloud plots and similar approaches, outline potential modifications for their optimal use, and provide open-source code for their streamlined implementation in R, Python and Matlab (

As the strive for realism continues, there is a need to investigate the effect of photorealism on users’ perception, particularly for interactive, emotional scenarios in VR. In this article, we explored three main topics, where we predicted photorealism will make a difference: the illusion of being present with the virtual person and in an environment, altered emotional response toward the character, and a subtler response—comfort of being in close proximity to the character. We present a perceptual experiment, with an interactive expressive virtual character in VR, which was designed to induce particular social responses in people. Our participant pool was large (N = 797) and diverse in terms of demographics. We designed a between-group experiment, where each group saw either the realistic rendering or one of our stylized conditions (simple and sketch style), expressing one of three attitudes: Friendly, Unfriendly, or Sad. While the render style did not particularly effect the level of comfort with the character or increase the illusion of presence with it, our main finding shows that the photorealistic character changed the emotional responses of participants, compared to the stylized versions. We also found a preference for realism in VR, reflected in the affinity and higher place illusion in the scenario, rendered in the realistic render style.},

	abstract = {Brain dynamics           are thought to unfold on a network determined by the pattern of axonal connections linking pairs           of neuronal elements; the so-called connectome. Prior work has indicated that structural             brain           connectivity constrains pairwise correlations of brain dynamics           (“functional connectivity”), but it is not known whether inter-regional axonal           connectivity is related to the intrinsic dynamics of individual brain areas. Here we           investigate this relationship using a weighted, directed mesoscale mouse connectome from           the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas and resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI)             time-series data           measured in 184 brain regions in eighteen anesthetized mice. For each brain region, we measured           degree, betweenness, and clustering coefficient from weighted and unweighted, and directed and           undirected versions of the connectome. We then characterized the univariate rs-fMRI             dynamics           in each brain           region by computing 6930 time-series properties           using the time-series             analysis toolbox, hctsa. After correcting for regional           volume variations, strong and robust correlations between structural connectivity             properties and rs-fMRI dynamics were found only when edge weights were           accounted for, and were associated with variations in the autocorrelation properties of the           rs-fMRI signal. The strongest relationships were found for weighted in-degree, which was           positively correlated to the autocorrelation of fMRI time series at time lag             τ = 34 s (partial Spearman correlation ρ=0.58ρ=0.58{\textless}math display="inline" overflow="scroll" altimg="eq-00001.gif"{\textgreater} {\textless}mrow{\textgreater} {\textless}mo{\textgreater}ρ{\textless}/mo{\textgreater} {\textless}mo{\textgreater}={\textless}/mo{\textgreater} {\textless}mn{\textgreater}0.58{\textless}/mn{\textgreater} {\textless}/mrow{\textgreater} {\textless}/math{\textgreater}), as well as a range of related measures such as relative           high frequency power (f {\textgreater} 0.4 Hz: ρ=−0.43ρ=−0.43{\textless}math display="inline" overflow="scroll" altimg="eq-00002.gif"{\textgreater} {\textless}mrow{\textgreater} {\textless}mo{\textgreater}ρ{\textless}/mo{\textgreater} {\textless}mo{\textgreater}={\textless}/mo{\textgreater} {\textless}mo{\textgreater}−{\textless}/mo{\textgreater} {\textless}mn{\textgreater}0.43{\textless}/mn{\textgreater} {\textless}/mrow{\textgreater} {\textless}/math{\textgreater}). Our results indicate that the topology of inter-regional           axonal connections of the mouse brain is closely related to intrinsic, spontaneous dynamics such that           regions with a greater aggregate strength of incoming projections display longer           timescales of activity fluctuations.},

However, whether abnormalities at the cellular level can be diagnosed from network activity measured withfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is largely unknown, yet of high clinical relevance. Here we applied fMRI while using chemogenetics to increase the excitation-to-inhibition ratio (E:I) within cortical microcircuits of the mouse brain, thereby mimicking a putative mechanism of neurodevelopmental disorders including autism. Increased E:I caused a significant reduction of long-range connectivity, irrespective of whether excitatory neurons were facilitated or inhibitory Parvalbumin interneurons were suppressed. Training a classifier on fMRI signals, we were able to accurately classify cortical areas exhibiting increased E:I. This classifier was validated in an independent cohort of Fmr1y/- knock-out mice, a model for autism with well-documented loss of Parvalbumin neurons and chronic alterations of E:I. Our findings demonstrate a promising novel approach towards inferring microcircuit abnormalities from macroscopic fMRI measurements.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here, rats earned a high-value sucrose reward by lever pressing on a progressive ratio schedule in either the presence (choice) or absence (no-choice) of freely available, low-value lab chow. Disruption of ACC, either via chemogenetic inhibition or excitation, reduced lever pressing for high-value reward in the choice, but not in the no-choice, condition. In vivo calcium imaging revealed cell populations in ACC that selectively responded prior to lever pressing and during sucrose retrieval. These responses were significantly weaker during choice than no-choice sessions, which may have rendered them more susceptible to chemogenetic disruption. Our results suggest that neural responses in ACC encode the relative value of competing outcomes, and that the amount of effort an animal is willing to exert is proportional to the magnitude of this relative value signal.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The average environmental and occupational physiologist may find statistics are difficult to interpret and use since their formal training in statistics is limited. Unfortunately, poor statistical practices can generate erroneous or at least misleading results and distorts the evidence in the scientific literature. These problems are exacerbated when statistics are used as thoughtless ritual that is performed after the data are collected. The situation is worsened when statistics are then treated as strict judgements about the data (i.e., significant versus non-significant) without a thought given to how these statistics were calculated or their practical meaning. We propose that researchers should consider statistics at every step of the research process whether that be the designing of experiments, collecting data, analysing the data or disseminating the results. When statistics are considered as an integral part of the research process, from start to finish, several problematic practices can be mitigated. Further, proper practices in disseminating the results of a study can greatly improve the quality of the literature. Within this review, we have included a number of reminders and statistical questions researchers should answer throughout the scientific process. Rather than treat statistics as a strict rule following procedure we hope that readers will use this review to stimulate a discussion around their current practices and attempt to improve them.

We detail four areas of the field where the joint analysis of neural populations has significantly furthered our understanding of computation in the brain: correlated variability, decoding, neural dynamics, and artificial neural networks. Together, these findings suggest an exciting trend towards a new era where neural populations are understood to be the essential unit of computation in many brain regions, a classic idea that has been given new life.},

Claims of significant population structure support hypotheses in many brain areas. However, these claims require first investigating the possibility that the population structure in question is an expected byproduct of simpler features known to exist in data. Classically, this critical examination can be either intuited or addressed with conventional controls. However, these approaches fail when considering population data, raising concerns about the scientific merit of population-level studies. Here we develop a framework to test the novelty of population-level findings against simpler features such as correlations across times, neurons and conditions. We apply this framework to test two recent population findings in prefrontal and motor cortices, providing essential context to those studies. More broadly, the methodologies we introduce provide a general neural population control for many population-level hypotheses.},

	abstract = {Introduction: The subiculum is one of the primary outputs of the hippocampus and projects to multiple cortical and subcortical structures. The subiculum has been implicated to play a role in spatial navigation and memory, and control the response to stress (O’Mara 2005). Subicular neurons have been observed to classify into bursting and non-bursting groups from in vitro and in vivo studies (Stewart and Wong 1993; Sharp and Green 1994). Evidence shows that bursting in subicular cells is vital to spatial information processing, and that switching between bursting and single spiking modes is imperative to information routing (Simonnet and Brecht 2019; Cooper, Chung, and Spruston 2005). Here, we sought to investigate the effect of anterior thalamus (ATN) lesion-induced dysfunction on the bursting properties of subicular neurons.

Methods: We performed in vivo extracellular single-unit and local field potential recordings in the dorsal subiculum using multiple indwelling electrodes while simultaneously recording the local field potential in the retrosplenial cortex. A total of 18 rats (3 control, 3 sham, 6 ATN-lesioned, 6 with temporary inactivation of ATN using muscimol) were recorded during exploration and behavioural tasks. Single-unit activity was isolated using automatic clustering with TINT software (Axona Ltd, St Albans, UK) followed by manual adjustment of the clusters.

Statistical analysis: Single unit properties were determined using NeuroChaT (Islam 2019) to separate cells into bursting units, regular spiking units, theta-modulated units, and fast spiking units following previous in-depth in vivo analysis (Anderson and O’Mara 2003). To further test cell groupings, hierarchical clustering using Ward’s method was performed on the principal components of the inter-spike interval and the autocorrelation histogram of detected single-units in Python (Simonnet and Brecht 2019).

Results: Place, head-direction and grid cells were recorded in the dorsal subiculum of control rats. However, the absence of ATN input to the hippocampal formation led to a degradation in spatial properties of subicular cells and no spatially tuned cells were recorded in the subiculum of ATN-lesioned rats. Given the evidence that burst firing in the subiculum is relevant to spatially tuned neurons (Simonnet and Brecht 2019), we show the effect of spatial information degradation by ATN-lesion induced dysfunction on bursting in subicular principal cells.},

The females were both conditioned and tested for retention at the same stage of the estrous cycle, during either estrus or proestrus. Male rats followed a regime similar to that for the female rats. Approximately 2 weeks after conditioning, the animals were examined for retention of the spatial context and of an explicitly paired conditioning tone. All animals showed a similar degree of conditioning to the tone. However, female proestrous rats showed less spatial-contextual conditioning than did male or estrous female rats. These results suggest that the changes found during the proestrous part of the cycle are related to hippocampal information processing and not to general changes in learning ability, to shock sensitivity, or to state-dependent learning. The results are discussed and related to previous findings regarding estrous cycle changes in behavior, anatomy, and physiology.},

Since then, similar enduring effects of early testosterone exposure have been found in other species, including humans, and for other behaviors that show average sex differences. In humans, the affected outcomes include gender identity, sexual orientation, and children’s sex-typical play behavior. The evidence linking early testosterone exposure to sex-typed play is particularly robust, and sex-typed play is also influenced by many other factors, including socialization by parents and peers and self-socialization, based on cognitive understanding of gender. In addition to influencing behavior, testosterone and hormones produced from testosterone affect mammalian brain structure. Studies using human autopsy material have found some sex differences in the human brain similar to those seen in other species, and have reported that some brain sex differences correlate with sexual orientation or gender identity, although the causes of these brain/behavior relationships are unclear. Studies that have imaged the living human brain have found only a small number of sex differences, and these differences are generally small in magnitude. In addition, they have not been linked to robust psychological or behavioral sex differences. Future research might benefit from improved imaging technology, and attention to other brain characteristics. In addition, it might usefully explore how different types of factors, such as early testosterone exposure and parental socialization, work together in the developmental system that produces sex/gender differences in human brain and behavior.},

However, reports documenting stimulus dependency and time variability of gamma frequency suggest that distant neuronal populations may, at any one time, operate at different frequencies precluding synchronization. To test this idea, we recorded from macaque V1 and V2 simultaneously while presenting gratings of varying contrast. Although gamma frequency increased with stimulus contrast in V1 and V2 (by ∼25 Hz), V1-V2 gamma coherence was maintained for all contrasts. Moreover, while gamma frequency fluctuated by ∼15 Hz during constant contrast stimulation, this fluctuation was highly correlated between V1 and V2. The strongest coherence connections showed a layer-specific pattern, matching feedforward anatomical connectivity. Hence, gamma coherence among remote populations can occur despite large stimulus-induced and time-dependent changes in gamma frequency, allowing communication through coherence to operate without a stimulus independent, fixed-frequency gamma channel.},

The patterns of synchronization are prevalent among stimulus-selective neurons and are governed by influences arising in parietal cortex. These results indicate that short-term memories are represented by large-scale patterns of synchronized activity across the fronto-parietal network.

Does this synchrony result from intrinsic activity in visual cortex or from inputs from other structures? Using paired recordings in the frontal eye field (FEF) and area V4, we found that attention to a stimulus in their joint receptive field leads to enhanced oscillatory coupling between the two areas, particularly at gamma frequencies. This coupling appeared to be initiated by FEF and was time-shifted by about 8 to 13 milliseconds across a range of frequencies. Considering the expected conduction and synaptic delays between the areas, this time-shifted coupling at gamma frequencies may optimize the postsynaptic impact of spikes from one area upon the other, improving cross-area communication with attention.

It has been suggested that gamma power indicates the strength of neuronal population synchrony, which influences the relaying of signals between cortical areas. However, the relationship between coordinated spiking activity and gamma remains unclear, and the influence on corticocortical signaling largely untested. We investigated these issues by recording from neuronal populations in areas V1 and V2 of anesthetized macaque monkeys. We found that visual stimuli that induce a strong, coherent gamma rhythm result in enhanced pairwise and higher-order V1 synchrony. This is associated with stronger coupling of V1-V2 spiking activity, in a retinotopically specific manner. Coupling is more strongly related to the gamma modulation of V1 firing than to the downstream V2 rhythm. Our results thus show that elevated gamma power is associated with stronger coordination of spiking activity both within and between cortical areas.},

When one of those stimuli activated one V1 site, it gamma synchronized (60–80 Hz) to V4. When the two stimuli activated two V1 sites, primarily the relevant one gamma synchronized to V4. Frequency bands of gamma activities showed substantial overlap containing the band of interareal coherence. The relevant V1 site had its gamma peak frequency 2–3 Hz higher than the irrelevant V1 site and 4–6 Hz higher than V4. Gamma-mediated interareal influences were predominantly directed from V1 to V4.

Deep neural networks trained on object classification tasks are a natural testbed for the applicability of this relation. We show how classification capacity improves along the hierarchies of deep neural networks with different architectures. We demonstrate that changes in the geometry of the associated object manifolds underlie this improved capacity, and shed light on the functional roles different levels in the hierarchy play to achieve it, through orchestrated reduction of manifolds’ radius, dimensionality and inter-manifold correlations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

How does the cortex achieve this stable control? Using the sensorimotor system as a model of cortical processing, we investigated the hypothesis that the dynamics of neural latent activity, which capture the dominant co-variation patterns within the neural population, are preserved across time. We recorded from populations of neurons in premotor, primary motor, and somatosensory cortices for up to two years as monkeys performed a reaching task. Intriguingly, despite steady turnover in the recorded neurons, the low-dimensional latent dynamics remained stable. Such stability allowed reliable decoding of behavioral features for the entire timespan, while fixed decoders based on the recorded neural activity degraded substantially. We posit that latent cortical dynamics within the manifold are the fundamental and stable building blocks underlying consistent behavioral execution.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The amplitude and phase of the oscillation followed naturally from the preceding state, suggesting a role for preparatory neural activity in reaching.},

Studies were performed in the Rhesus monkey during tasks which required saccadic eye movements to remembered target locations in the dark. Neurons were found which remained active during the time period for which the monkey had to withhold eye movements while remembering desired target locations. The activity of the cells was tuned for eye movements of specific direction and amplitude, and it was not necessary for a visual stimulus to fall within the response field. The responses appeared to represent a memory-related motor-planning signal encoding motor error. The relation of the activity to the behavior of the animal suggests that the response represents the intent to make eye movements of specific direction and amplitude.},

Here, we describe a modeling approach that yields a quantitatively accurate model of inferior temporal (IT) cortex, the highest ventral cortical area. Using high-throughput computational techniques, we discovered that, within a class of biologically plausible hierarchical neural network models, there is a strong correlation between a model's categorization performance and its ability to predict individual IT neural unit response data. To pursue this idea, we then identified a high-performing neural network that matches human performance on a range of recognition tasks. Critically, even though we did not constrain this model to match neural data, its top output layer turns out to be highly predictive of IT spiking responses to complex naturalistic images at both the single site and population levels. Moreover, the model's intermediate layers are highly predictive of neural responses in the V4 cortex, a midlevel visual area that provides the dominant cortical input to IT. These results show that performance optimization--applied in a biologically appropriate model class--can be used to build quantitative predictive models of neural processing.},

Understanding how low-dimensional computations on mixed, distributed representations emerge from the structure of the recurrent connectivity and inputs to cortical networks is a major challenge. Here, we study a class of recurrent network models in which the connectivity is a sum of a random part and a minimal, low-dimensional structure. We show that, in such networks, the dynamics are low dimensional and can be directly inferred from connectivity using a geometrical approach. We exploit this understanding to determine minimal connectivity required to implement specific computations and find that the dynamical range and computational capacity quickly increase with the dimensionality of the connectivity structure. This framework produces testable experimental predictions for the relationship between connectivity, low-dimensional dynamics, and computational features of recorded neurons.},

The underlying neuronal dynamics and brainwide interactions important for passive coping have remained unclear. Here, we develop a paradigm to study these behavioral state transitions at cellular-resolution across the entire vertebrate brain. Using brainwide imaging in zebrafish, we observed that the transition to passive coping is manifested by progressive activation of neurons in the ventral (lateral) habenula. Activation of these ventral-habenula neurons suppressed downstream neurons in the serotonergic raphe nucleus and caused behavioral passivity, whereas inhibition of these neurons prevented passivity. Data-driven recurrent neural network modeling pointed to altered intra-habenula interactions as a contributory mechanism. These results demonstrate ongoing encoding of experience features in the habenula, which guides recruitment of downstream networks and imposes a passive coping behavioral strategy.},

	abstract = {A major tenet in theoretical neuroscience is that cognitive and behavioral processes are ultimately implemented in terms of the neural system dynamics. Accordingly, a major aim for the analysis of neurophysiological measurements should lie in the identification of the computational dynamics underlying task processing. Here we advance a state space model (SSM) based on generative piecewise-linear recurrent neural networks (PLRNN) to assess dynamics from neuroimaging data. In contrast to many other nonlinear time series models which have been proposed for reconstructing latent dynamics, our model is easily interpretable in neural terms, amenable to systematic dynamical systems analysis of the resulting set of equations, and can straightforwardly be transformed into an equivalent continuous-time dynamical system. The major contributions of this paper are the introduction of a new observation model suitable for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) coupled to the latent PLRNN, an efficient stepwise training procedure that forces the latent model to capture the ‘true’ underlying dynamics rather than just fitting (or predicting) the observations, and of an empirical measure based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence to evaluate from empirical time series how well this goal of approximating the underlying dynamics has been achieved. We validate and illustrate the power of our approach on simulated ‘ground-truth’ dynamical systems as well as on experimental fMRI time series, and demonstrate that the learnt dynamics harbors task-related nonlinear structure that a linear dynamical model fails to capture. Given that fMRI is one of the most common techniques for measuring brain activity non-invasively in human subjects, this approach may provide a novel step toward analyzing aberrant (nonlinear) dynamics for clinical assessment or neuroscientific research.},

A large body of methods have been developed to study neuronal firing at the single cell and population levels, generally seeking interpretability as well as predictivity.

Here, using neuronal data from the head-direction (HD) system, we present evidence demonstrating how gradient boosted trees, a non-linear and supervised Machine Learning tool, can learn the relationship between behavioral parameters and neuronal responses with high accuracy by optimizing the information rate. Interestingly, and unlike other classes of Machine Learning methods, the intrinsic structure of the trees can be interpreted in relation to behavior (e.g. to recover the tuning curves) or to study how neurons cooperate with their peers in the network. We show how the method, unlike linear analysis, reveals that the coordination in thalamo-cortical circuits is qualitatively the same during wakefulness and sleep, indicating a brain-state independent feed-forward circuit. Machine Learning tools thus open new avenues for benchmarking model-based characterization of spike trains.},

How path integration and contextual cues are dynamically combined and processed by the hippocampus to maintain these representations accurate over time remains unclear. To answer this question, we propose a two-way data analysis and modeling approach to CA3 multi-electrode recordings of a moving rat submitted to rapid changes of contextual (light) cues, triggering back-and-forth instabitilies between two cognitive representations (“teleportation” experiment of Jezek et al). We develop a dual neural activity decoder, capable of independently identifying the recalled cognitive map at high temporal resolution (comparable to theta cycle) and the position of the rodent given a map. Remarkably, position can be reconstructed at any time with an accuracy comparable to fixed-context periods, even during highly unstable periods. These findings provide evidence for the capability of the hippocampal neural activity to maintain an accurate encoding of spatial and contextual variables, while one of these variables undergoes rapid changes independently of the other. To explain this result we introduce an attractor neural network model for the hippocampal activity that process inputs from external cues and the path integrator. Our model allows us to make predictions on the frequency of the cognitive map instability, its duration, and the detailed nature of the place-cell population activity, which are validated by a further analysis of the data. Our work therefore sheds light on the mechanisms by which the hippocampal network achieves and updates multi-dimensional neural representations from various input streams.},

Due to the novelty of the concept, various measures are used in the literature to calculate phase-amplitude coupling. Here, performance of the three most widely used phase-amplitude coupling measures – phase-locking value (PLV), mean vector length (MVL), and modulation index (MI) – and of the generalized linear modeling cross-frequency coupling (GLM-CFC) method is thoroughly compared with the help of simulated data. We combine advantages of previous reviews and use a realistic data simulation, examine moderators and provide inferential statistics for the comparison of all four indices of phase-amplitude coupling. Our analyses show that all four indices successfully differentiate coupling strength and coupling width when monophasic coupling is present. While the mean vector length was most sensitive to modulations in coupling strengths and width, only the modulation index and GLM-CFC can detect biphasic coupling. Coupling values of all four indices were influenced by moderators including data length, signal-to-noise-ratio, and sampling rate when approaching Nyquist frequencies. The modulation index was most robust against confounding influences of these moderators. Based on our analyses, we recommend the modulation index for noisy and short data epochs with unknown forms of coupling. For high quality and long data epochs with monophasic coupling and a high signal-to-noise ratio, the use of the mean vector length is recommended. Ideally, both indices are reported simultaneously for one data set.},

These models can feature novel dynamical equations, their interactions with the environment, and experimental protocols. To preserve high performance when defining new models, most simulators offer two options: low-level programming or description languages. The first option requires expertise, is prone to errors, and is problematic for reproducibility. The second option cannot describe all aspects of a computational experiment, such as the potentially complex logic of a stimulation protocol. Brian addresses these issues using runtime code generation. Scientists write code with simple and concise high-level descriptions, and Brian transforms them into efficient low-level code that can run interleaved with their code. We illustrate this with several challenging examples: a plastic model of the pyloric network, a closed-loop sensorimotor model, a programmatic exploration of a neuron model, and an auditory model with real-time input.},

Decoding provides a means to infer the information content of such recordings but typically requires highly processed data and prior knowledge of variables. Here, we developed DeepInsight - a deep-learning-framework able to decode sensory and behavioural variables directly from wide-band neural data. The network requires little user input and generalizes across stimuli, behaviours, brain regions, and recording techniques. Critically, once trained, it can be analysed to determine elements of the neural code that are informative about a given variable. We validated this approach using data from rodent auditory cortex and hippocampus, identifying a novel representation of head direction encoded by CA1 interneurons. Thus, we present a robust, user-friendly tool for characterising and decoding neural recordings in an automated way.

Interpreting neuronal population activity by reconstruction: unified framework with application to hippocampal place cells. J. Neurophysiol. 79: 1017–1044, 1998. Physical variables such as the orientation of a line in the visual field or the location of the body in space are coded as activity levels in populations of neurons. Reconstruction or decoding is an inverse problem in which the physical variables are estimated from observed neural activity. Reconstruction is useful first in quantifying how much information about the physical variables is present in the population and, second, in providing insight into how the brain might use distributed representations in solving related computational problems such as visual object recognition and spatial navigation. Two classes of reconstruction methods, namely, probabilistic or Bayesian methods and basis function methods, are discussed. They include important existing methods as special cases, such as population vector coding, optimal linear estimation, and template matching. As a representative example for the reconstruction problem, different methods were applied to multi-electrode spike train data from hippocampal place cells in freely moving rats. The reconstruction accuracy of the trajectories of the rats was compared for the different methods. Bayesian methods were especially accurate when a continuity constraint was enforced, and the best errors were within a factor of two of the information-theoretic limit on how accurate any reconstruction can be and were comparable with the intrinsic experimental errors in position tracking. In addition, the reconstruction analysis uncovered some interesting aspects of place cell activity, such as the tendency for erratic jumps of the reconstructed trajectory when the animal stopped running. In general, the theoretical values of the minimal achievable reconstruction errors quantify how accurately a physical variable is encoded in the neuronal population in the sense of mean square error, regardless of the method used for reading out the information. One related result is that the theoretical accuracy is independent of the width of the Gaussian tuning function only in two dimensions. Finally, all the reconstruction methods considered in this paper can be implemented by a unified neural network architecture, which the brain feasibly could use to solve related problems.},

Firing can be in either tonic or burst mode. Although bursting neurons are common in the hippocampal formation, the characteristics of their locking to LFP phase are not completely understood. We investigated phase-locking properties of bursting neurons using simulations generated by a dual compartmental model of a pyramidal neuron adapted to match the bursting activity in the subiculum of a rat. The model was driven with stochastic input signals containing a power spectral profile consistent with physiologically relevant frequencies observed in LFP. The single spikes and spike bursts fired by the model were locked to a preferred phase of the predominant frequency band where there was a peak in the power of the driving signal. Moreover, the preferred phase of locking shifted with increasing burst size, providing evidence that LFP phase can be encoded by burst size. We also provide initial support for the model results by analysing example data of spontaneous LFP and spiking activity recorded from the subiculum of a single urethane-anaesthetised rat. Subicular neurons fired single spikes, two-spike bursts and larger bursts that locked to a preferred phase of either dominant slow oscillations or theta rhythms within the LFP, according to the model prediction. Both power-modulated phase-locking and gradual shift in the preferred phase of locking as a function of burst size suggest that neurons can use bursts to encode timing information contained in LFP phase into a spike-count code.},

The diverse spatial signals normally found in the subiculum, including place cells, disappeared following permanent thalamic lesions and showed marked disruption during transient lesions. Meanwhile, permanent anterior thalamic lesions had no discernible impact on CA1 place fields. Thalamic lesions reduced spatial alternation performance (permanently or reversibly) to chance levels, while leaving a non-spatial recognition memory task unaffected. These findings, which help to explain why anterior thalamic damage is so deleterious for spatial memory, cast a new spotlight on the importance of subiculum function, and reveal its dependence on anterior thalamic signalling.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
